GCS was 10/15.  \\nThe initial labs revealed leukocytosis (TLC > 20000) and CRP of 149. The blood and urine \\ncultures were sent and the patient was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotic (Piperacillin - \\nTazobactum). The patient was continued with supportiv e treatment with IV fluids, IV \\nAnalgesics, Nebulization with Duolin/Budecort and IV Multivitamins. After initial \\nstabilization the patient was shifted to ICU. The relatives were counselled and explained about \\nthe condition of the patient and further plan o f management.  \\nThe working diagnosis was acute febrile illness. The flu panel was sent which was negative.  \\nThe Peripheral Smear for Malaria Parasite/Rapid Malaria Antigen was negative  \\nThe Dengue workup (Dengue IgM/IgG/NS1 antigen) was negative as well.    \\n \\nThe patient became hypoxic and started requiring supplemental oxygen through nasal prongs. \\nThe patient’s blood pressure was high and hence was started on IV NTG infusion. The patient’s \\ncough reflex was poor and airway protection was suboptimal. The patien t had difficulty in \\nswallowing and was clinically aspirating. Ryle’s tube insertion was advised to ensure safe \\nenteral feeding and for giving medications. The relatives (DAUGHTER -SEEMA VARMA) \\nwere counselled and explained about the need of the Ryle’s tube insertion however the relatives \\nwere unwilling for the same. The neurology opinion was taken from Dr. Mohit Bhat who \\nagreed with the plan of Ryle’s tube insertion. The relatives were again explained about the need \\nof Ryle’s tube insertion; the relatives re mained undecided.  \\n \\nThe reference was given to Dr. Tanu Singhal (Infection Disease specialist) in view of aspiration \\npneumonitis. The ongoing antibiotic management was to be continued.  \\n \\nCT Chest/Abdomen done showed multiple nodules in right middle lobe and right lower lobe \\nwith multiple patchy consolidations suggestive of infective etiology. Areas of ground glass \\nopacities were also seen in right and left upper lobes. Prostatomegaly and minimal perivesicular \\nfat stranding also seen.  \\n \\nThe 2D Echo done showed LVEF -55% with no R WMA with mild PH seen.  \\n \\nThe patient continued to remain drowsy. The airway protection was suboptimal and the patient \\nwas clinically aspirating. The swallow assessment was done to objectively determine the safety \\nin initiation of the oral feeds. The assessm ent showed delay in swallow initiation. Post swallow \\nassessment there was a strong recommendation to keep the patient nil by mouth and to look for \\nalternate means of nutrition and medications.  \\nThe relatives were again counselled and explained about the ne ed of Ryle’s tube insertion. The \\nrelatives again refused for the Ryle’s tube insertion.  \\n \\nIV Labetalol and NTG infusion continued as oral anti -hypertensives could not be given due to \\nswallow dysfunction.  \\nPotassium correction was given with 1/2NS+10meq KCL  \\n \\nOn 06/08/2023 Relatives agreed for insertion of Ryle’s tube. RT was inserted and planned for \\nstarting oral antihypertensives and feeds.  \\n \\nPresently the patient is oxygenating well on room air. The patient remains hypertensive \\nrequiring IV NTG and labetolol  infusions. The patient is drowsy. The airway protection \\nremains suboptimal.  \\nThe patient needs further ICU stay and further critical care monitoring and management. The \\nrelatives have been explained about the same. The relatives want to take discharge aga inst \\nmedical advice. The relatives have been explained that this can cause deleterious effects on the \\nclinical condition of the patient. The relatives have been explained about the possibility of life \\nthreatening complications arising from the uncontrolled  blood pressure and aspiration \\npneumonitis. It has been explained to them that the patient needs to complete the course of IV \\nantibiotics.  \\nAll the queries of the relatives have been answered.

His previous medications included - thyroid supplementation, oral \\nhypogl ycemic, oral anti - hypertensive medications and anti - parkinsonian medicines.  \\n \\nVitals on admission were: HR -92/min, SPO2 -94% on RA, BP -160/100mmHG, RR -17/min T -\\n97.8 degree F, and HGT -190 mg/dl. GCS was 10/15.  \\nThe initial labs revealed leukocytosis (TLC >  20000) and CRP of 149. The blood and urine \\ncultures were sent and the patient was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotic (Piperacillin - \\nTazobactum). The patient was continued with supportive treatment with IV fluids, IV \\nAnalgesics, Nebulization with Duol in/Budecort and IV Multivitamins. After initial \\nstabilization the patient was shifted to ICU. The relatives were counselled and explained about \\nthe condition of the patient and further plan of management.  \\nThe working diagnosis was acute febrile illness. T he flu panel was sent which was negative.  \\nThe Peripheral Smear for Malaria Parasite/Rapid Malaria Antigen was negative  \\nThe Dengue workup (Dengue IgM/IgG/NS1 antigen) was negative as well.    \\n \\nThe patient became hypoxic and started requiring supplemental ox ygen through nasal prongs. \\nThe patient’s blood pressure was high and hence was started on IV NTG infusion. The patient’s \\ncough reflex was poor and airway protection was suboptimal. The patient had difficulty in \\nswallowing and was clinically aspirating. Ryl e’s tube insertion was advised to ensure safe \\nenteral feeding and for giving medications. The relatives (DAUGHTER -SEEMA VARMA) \\nwere counselled and explained about the need of the Ryle’s tube insertion however the relatives \\nwere unwilling for the same.

Hypothyroidism. Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. (Stopped medications on self since 6 months) Presenting Complaints : Patient came with c/o fever since 1 -2 days with progressive drowsiness and reduced oral i ntake since 2 days. COURSE IN HOSPITAL : Patient was admitted to ICU in view of above complaints. Patient relatives (son and daughter) gave history of stopping all his old medications and routine consultation with Neurologist since last 6 months. His pr evious medications included - thyroid supplementation, oral hypoglycemic, oral anti - hypertensive medications and anti - parkinsonian medicines.  Treating Doctor : Dr  Vatsal Kothari Vitals on admission were: HR -92/min, SPO2 -94% on RA, BP -160/100mmHG, RR -17/min T - 97.8 degree F, and HGT -190 mg/ dl. GCS was 10/15. The initial labs revealed leukocytosis (TLC > 20000) and CRP of 149. The blood and urine cultures were sent and the patient was started on broad spectrum IV antibiotic (Piperacillin - Tazobactum). The patient was continued with supportiv e treatment with IV fluids, IV Analgesics, Nebulization with Duolin/Budecort and IV Multivitamins. After initial stabilization the patient was shifted to ICU. The relatives were counselled and explained about the condition of the patient and further plan o f management. The working diagnosis was acute febrile illness. The flu panel was sent which was negative. The Peripheral Smear for Malaria Parasite/Rapid Malaria Antigen was negative The Dengue workup (Dengue IgM/IgG/NS1 antigen) was negative as well. The patient became hypoxic and started requiring supplemental oxygen through nasal prongs. The patient’s blood pressure was high and hence was started on IV NTG infusion. The patient’s cough reflex was poor and airway protection was suboptimal. The patien t had difficulty in swallowing and was clinically aspirating. Ryle’s tube insertion was advised to ensure safe enteral feeding and for giving medications. The relatives (DAUGHTER -SEEMA VARMA) were counselled and explained about the need of the Ryle’s tube insertion however the relatives were unwilling for the same. The neurology opinion was taken from Dr. Mohit Bhat who agreed with the plan of Ryle’s tube insertion. The relatives were again explained about the need of Ryle’s tube insertion; the relatives re mained undecided. The reference was given to Dr. Tanu Singhal (Infection Disease specialist) in view of aspiration pneumonitis. The ongoing antibiotic management was to be continued. CT Chest/Abdomen done showed multiple nodules in right middle lobe and right lower lobe with multiple patchy consolidations suggestive of infective etiology. Areas of ground glass opacities were also seen in right and left upper lobes. Prostatomegaly and minimal perivesicular fat stranding also seen. The 2D Echo done showed LVEF -55% with no R WMA with mild PH seen. The patient continued to remain drowsy. The airway protection was suboptimal and the patient was clinically aspirating. The swallow assessment was done to objectively determine the safety in initiation of the oral feeds. The assessm ent showed delay in swallow initiation. Post swallow assessment there was a strong recommendation to keep the patient nil by mouth and to look for alternate means of nutrition and medications. The relatives were again counselled and explained about the ne ed of Ryle’s tube insertion. The relatives again refused for the Ryle’s tube insertion. IV Labetalol and NTG infusion continued as oral anti -hypertensives could not be given due to swallow dysfunction. Potassium correction was given with 1/2NS+10meq KCL On 06/08/2023 Relatives agreed for insertion of Ryle’s tube. RT was inserted and planned for starting oral antihypertensives and feeds. Presently the patient is oxygenating well on room air. The patient remains hypertensive requiring IV NTG and labetolol  infusions. The patient is drowsy. The airway protection remains suboptimal. The patient needs further ICU stay and further critical care monitoring and management. The relatives have been explained about the same. The relatives want to take discharge aga inst medical advice.
