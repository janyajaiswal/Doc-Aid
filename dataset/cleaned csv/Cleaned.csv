"An 84-year-old woman presented to a local clinic with dyspnea on exertion and left back pain persisting for a month.
She was admitted to our hospital because of left pleural effusion on a chest X-ray.
She suffered hypertension and dyslipidemia but had no history of pleural tuberculosis or chronic pyothorax, nor a smoking history or dust exposure.
On examination, her vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal (SpO2: 96% ambient air).
A chest examination revealed a mass on the left side of her back with pain and decreased breathing sounds in the left lower-lung field.
The rest of the examination findings were normal.
Laboratory tests revealed elevated levels of C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) (Table 1).
A chest X-ray (Fig.1) showed left pleural effusion with mediastinal shift.
On the first hospital day, an intercostal drainage tube was inserted, and after drainage, chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig.2) revealed an irregular pleural mass invading her left chest wall with rib destruction and pleural effusion.
The mass was adjacent to the posterior mediastinum, but the lateral side of the mass was thick and invading the chest wall, so we diagnosed this mass as a chest wall tumor.
The pleural fluid was serous and not purulent.
A fluid analysis showed it to be exudative, and 81% of the white blood cells were lymphocytes.
The fluid culture was negative, and cytology did not show any evidence of malignancy (Table 1).
CT-guided needle biopsy was performed.
The histopathology results supported a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that was positive for CD10 and CD20 but negative for CD3 and CD5 (Fig.3).
18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) revealed high FDG uptake in the left chest wall mass without any other uptake (Fig.4A and B), so we diagnosed her with primary malignant lymphoma originating from the chest wall.
We reconfirmed her medical history, and she never had either tuberculous pleurisy or pyothorax.
Her performance status (PS) was 3 because of her back pain and fatigue.
Owing to her bad PS and age, it was difficult to perform an operation or administer combination chemotherapy with Rituximab, so low-dose oral etoposide (50 mg/day d1-14, q28) was administered.
Her pleural effusion disappeared within two weeks, her back pain disappeared, and her PS improved to 1 within a month.
Chest CT performed four months later showed complete response (Fig.4C and D).
She continued oral chemotherapy and maintained a good PS for one year after the diagnosis.

"An 18-year-old college student was referred from the University Clinic for having low hemoglobin (Hg 4.7 g/dl).
He was completely well till one month back when he presented with easy fatigability, postural dizziness, palpitation and dyspnea.
He gave history of 30 kg weight loss over the past 6 months.
On physical examination, he looked pale, not jaundiced or cyanosed.
His vital signs were all within normal limits, except for an elevated heart rate (98/min).
Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.
Primary investigations in our hospital revealed low hemoglobin level (5.1 g/dl), low iron (<10 ug/dl), and a positive occult blood test.
A provisional diagnosis of microcytic hypochromic anemia for further workup was made.
Bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy revealed normocellular marrow, depicting normal trilineage hematopoiesis.
Upper GI endoscopy showed erosive antral gastritis with patchy ulcerative inflammation.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a slightly enlarged liver with a rounded echogenic lesion in the anterior wall of the right lobe suggestive of hemangioma.
The spleen was slightly enlarged and normal in echogenicity with no focal lesions.
Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a fairly large well defined soft tissue mass located in the anterior upper pelvis and engulfing jejunal loops causing bowel wall thickening.
The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the jejunal mass.
Macroscopic examination revealed an 11 × 8 × 2 cm annular mass located within the jejunal wall ulcerating through the mucosa and extending to the serosal surface.
Microscopic examination revealed a tumor situated in the muscularis propria and extending to the mucosa and the serosa.
The neoplastic cells were arranged in predominantly pseudoalveolar pattern (Fig.1a,b).
They were polygonal in shape with variable amount of eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm (Fig.1c).
The nuclei were oval with vesicular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.
Scattered osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells were also identified (Fig.1b,c).
Frequent mitotic figures and necrosis were noted.
All lymph nodes were not involved by tumor.
Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely positive for S-100 protein (Fig.1d).
They were also positive for vimentin.
Melanocytic markers (HMB45 and Melan A), neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56), smooth muscle actin, desmin, CD34, CD117, cytokeratin and LCA were all negative in the neoplastic cells.
Fluorescein in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for EWSR1 break apart probe on paraffin-embedded tumor showed evidence of a 22q12 rearrangement in 197 out of 205 (96%) of interphase nuclei scored.
The native state of EWSR1 break apart probe will be seen as two adjacent or fused (overlapping) red/green (yellow) signals.
However, EWSR1 gene rearrangement presented as one red and one green separated signal (Fig.1e).
The patient did not receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
During the clinical follow up, the patient remained disease free for 3 years until he presented with local recurrence.
The treatment plan was surgical resection but the patient sought medical advice in a different institution where he died of the disease a year later.

"A 64-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University Medical College (Qingdao, China) due to epigastric pains.
Physical examination revealed no palpable mass, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly.
On endoscopy, several submucosal lesions were identified in the gastric antrum and the duodenal bulb (Fig.1).
Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) (OLYMPUS EUS EU-ME2, Miniprobe sonography) demonstrated that the lesions were almost 0.5-cm homogeneously hypoechoic neoplasms originating from the submucous layer (Fig.2) and the initial diagnosis was digestive neuroendocrine tumors.
Computed tomography revealed enlarged lymph nodes in multiple regions (mediastinal, retroperitoneal, mesenteric, and inguinal) and intracavitary nodules in the duodenum.
To reach a definitive diagnosis, the patient underwent repeat EUS and biopsy was performed.
On endoscopy, a 2 × 1-cm columnar uplift in the terminal ileum and multiple submucosal lesions in the rectum were identified (Fig.3).
EUS revealed that the lesions in the terminal ileum were sized 1.6 × 1.2 cm and the lesions in the rectum were sized almost 0.6 × 1.0 cm, they were all homogeneously hypoechoic and originated from the muscularis mucosa layer.
Pathological examination of the biopsied specimens from the lesions of the rectum showed diffuse lymphomatous proliferation and dense infiltration by monomorphic, small cleaved cells with irregularly shaped nuclei (Fig.4).
On immunohistochemical analysis, the cells were positive for cyclin D1, CD20, CD21, SOX-11, and Bcl-2, but negative for CD3 and CD10, which was compatible with the diagnosis of MCL.
Ki-67 staining revealed a proliferative index of 30%.
Based on these findings, the diagnosis of Ann Arbor stage IV MCL was confirmed.
The patient was referred for combination chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP regimen).
The patient has been in remission clinically.

"We report the case of a 68-year-old female with no past medical history, presented with an upper gastrointestinal bleeding and pain in left upper abdomen.
Physical examination found a splenomegaly and signs of portosystemic collateral formation including abdominal wall dilated veins and rectal haemorrhoids.
No biological abnormalities were noted besides those due to hypersplenism (anaemia and thrombocytopenia).
The patient underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that showed stage III oesophageal varices with portal hypertensive gastropathy and red signs.
Ultrasonography revealed a fusiform dilatation of the portal bifurcation measuring 40 mm in diameter with dilated branches; no signs of portal thrombosis were detected (Figure 1).
The portal Doppler study showed a normal hepatopetal flow.
Other signs of portal hypertension were found, including splenomegaly, repermeation of the umbilical vein and a splenorenal collateral circulation.
A complementary angio-CT allowed a better assessment of the portal system that contained some thin calcifications in the aneurysmal wall and the main portal trunk (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4).
Other signs of portal hypertension were noted such as oesophageal and gastric varices, parietal collateral circulation associated to ultrasonography findings.
Liver cirrhosis was confirmed by transcient elastometry and biopsy.

"A 57-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with 5 months’ history of massive rectal bleeding (rectorrhagia).
He had past history of passage of fresh blood mixed stool since last 55 years.
He first complained of rectal bleeding at the age of 2.
He went hospital numerous times for this symptom; multiple interventions were done but disease was not cured completely.
During one of his hospital visit in the past (patient forgot the date), he was diagnosed and treated as hemorrhoids.
The symptom was relieved for a while and then recurred again.
Thirty years ago, he was diagnosed as rectal hemangioma and managed with cryotherapy in our hospital.
That could also just relieve the symptom for few years and it recurred again.
Then, he consulted many other hospitals, but could only get short-term symptomatic relief without proper treatment of the cause.
Since 5 months, the severity of rectal bleeding increased.
He then went to local hospital where intervention was done to control bleeding and symptomatic treatment was done with intravenous fluid and blood transfusion.
He finally referred to our hospital for further evaluation.
Intermediate rectal bleeding of fresh blood was presented on admission.
Patient complained of dizziness on standing, shortness of breath, and palpitation on walking a short distance.
There was no history of similar illness in family.
On general examination, patient appeared pale, but his heart rate and blood pressure were within normal limit during rest.
He lost 5 kg of his body weight during last 5 months.
On rectal examination, fresh blood was seen around anal region and soft mass was felt on digital rectal examination.
On proctoscopy, anal cavity and rectum were seen filled with fresh blood, but active site of bleeding, polyp, or ulcer was not detected.
On laboratory examination, red blood cell count was 3.09 × 1012/L (Normal: 4.32–5.72 × 1012/L) and hemoglobin was 86 g/L (Normal: 135–175 g/L).
All other parameters were within normal limit.
None enhanced CT showed isodense (35 HU) homogenous bowel wall thickening that on contrast-enhanced CT venous phase enhances heterogeneously.
Multiple calcifications were seen in the thickened bowel wall and around the peri-rectal area.
Lesion was seen extending from distal sigmoid to whole of the rectum (Fig.1).
Multiple hypodense lesions were also seen in spleen (Fig.2).
After initial management of anemia, the patient underwent abdominal laparotomy followed by surgical excision.
During surgery, 25 cm long lesion was found extending from distal sigmoid to whole of the rectum.
Whole of the rectum and part of the sigmoid colon were excised and sigmoid-anus anastomosis was done.
Postsurgical histopathological examination of excised specimen showed submucosal multiple thin-walled vessel of varying size with interposed stroma.
Some vessels lumen consisted of blood cells (consistent with blood vessel), whereas other consisted of clear fluid (consistent with lymph vessel).
Immunohistochemistry of specimen showed endothelial cells positive for CD 31 and CD 34.
Some cells were positive for D2–40, while others were negative for D2–40 (Fig.3).
On the basis of histopathological report and immunohistochemistry, hemolymphangioma was diagnosed.
The surgery, which followed by complication (intestinal infection), was well managed and the patient was discharged from hospital on the 23rd day of surgery.
Then after, no further complication or recurrence was noticed during 6 months’ follow-up.
This study was approved by the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University Institutional Review Board.
Written consent for this case report was obtained from the patient.

"A 68-year-old man referred to the Internal Medicine Department of Razi Hospital in Rasht (a city in the north of Iran) with a hypogastric region discomfort, especially in the right lower quadrant for one month.
The pain was a colicky form which had a few episodes each day, each episode lasting for 4–5 minutes.
The pain radiated to the back and was alleviated by resting to one side.
No association between the pain, defecation, and eating were reported.
Furthermore, the patient complained of a 2–3 kg weight loss over the last one month followed by anorexia.
However, no symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fever, or shaking chills were demonstrated.
He was first admitted to another center for a week, then was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.
The patient had undergone a surgery for prostatectomy seven years before his presentation to our center.
Also, he had a history of endoscopy five years earlier due to dyspepsia, which was found to be Helicobacter pylori positive at that time and which was eradicated after a treatment course.
No history of HIV, diabetes, smoking, or alcohol consumption was recorded.
His vital signs were normal at the time of admission.
On physical examination, the abdomen was soft, there was no distention, and bowel sounds were normoactive.
However, tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen with no rebound state was noted.
The peripheral blood analysis is shown in Table 1.
Stool examination, urine analysis, and evaluation of electrolytes were all normal.
An abdominal CT scan showed a well-demarcated and homogenous solitary mass in the cecum with no distention in the ileum.
The ileum wall was thickened (Figure 1).
A colonoscopy revealed a large mass like lesion in the cecum (Figure 2); during the procedure a biopsy was taken from the cecum.
The lamina propria was infiltrated by a number of PMNCs admixed by some eosinophils (Figure 3).
Immunohistochemical evaluation was positive for vimentin and CD68.
C-Kit (CD117) was negative while CD34, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and ALK were focally positive.
There were no reports of cyclin D1, desmin, or pancytokeratin (Figure 4).When the colonoscopy was performed, the evidences of invasive obstruction lead us to the suspicion of a malignant tumor.
After pathological confirmation of IMT, the patient was referred for surgery in order to remove the mass.
On surgery, approximately 40 mL ascites were found in the abdomen.
A mass was seen in the cecum with ileocolic intussusception.
Afterwards, the patient underwent right hemicolectomy with an end-to-end anastomosis of ileocolic.
No enlarge lymph nodes were observed.
The patient was discharged seven days after surgery and had no complications during follow-up.

"A 51-year-old G1P1 Caucasian female with lifelong neurogenic bladder secondary to spina bifida occulta was referred for symptoms of constipation and (FI).
She averaged one Bristol Type 1–2 stool every 5 days requiring frequent manual disimpaction.
Additionally, she reported twice weekly episodes of urgent fecal seepage, which required the use of daily continence pads.
Her symptoms did not improve with the addition of psyllium and bisacodyl suppositories.
A defecography suggested atrophy of the puborectalis and poor squeeze with EAS muscle atrophy.
Anorectal manometry (ARM) showed a normal resting pressure with no augmentation of squeeze pressure, consistent with weak EAS (Figure 1).
During bearing down, fixed perineal descent was noted with the inability to widen the posterior anorectal angle and poor evacuation of contrast with straining, consistent with DD.
With pushing, ARM similarly demonstrated type IV DD, which is classified as inability to generate adequate propulsive forces along with absent or incomplete relaxation of the anal sphincter [8] (Figure 2).
Reflex and sensory testing indicated an intact rectoanal inhibitory reflex and rectal hypersensitivity.
The patient failed management with home and conventional biofeedback therapy.
Following a successful trial of temporary SNS with improvement in FI symptoms by 75%, the patient had a permanent SNS placed.
One year later, the patient reports sustained improvement in constipation and FI symptoms.

"A 52-year-old man with a 30-year history of smoking presented with an abnormal nodule measuring 0.8 × 1.5 cm in the left upper lung lobe imaged through chest computed tomography (CT) scanning in March 2012 in a community hospital.
He had previously been well without any additional relevant or abnormal symptoms.
Physical examination suggested no significant abnormalities.
Laboratory findings were within normal range, except for a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level of 30.25 ng/mL (normal range, 0–5 ng/mL) found in the serum.
Subsequently, a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan showed a lung lesion with a standardized uptake value of 7.94, which was highly suspected to be a malignant tumor (Fig.1).
Subsequently, he underwent left upper lung lobectomy and lymph node dissection.
Postoperative pathological examination revealed an adenocarcinoma (ADC) (Fig.2A).
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining results were positive for CK7, TTF-1, p63, and NapsinA and negative for CK 5/6, Syn, cgA, and Ki-67 (20%–30%).
The clinical stage was classified as IA2 (pT1bN0M0).
Because the tumor was still in an early stage, the patient did not receive adjuvant treatment but continued to be monitored through regular hospital visits every 3 months.
The patient's condition had been stable until the onset of left chest pain in April 2015.
The patient was transferred to our hospital (a tertiary care hospital) for further treatment.
Physical examination suggested a significant tender point in the left chest wall.
Laboratory findings showed only a single parameter outside the normal range: the cytokeratin19 fragment antigen 21–1 (CYFRA21–1) level was 17.45 ng/mL in the serum (normal range = 0–3.3 ng/mL).
CT and PET/CT scans highlighted the serious involvement of left pleura, showing bilateral lung lesions (Fig.3A and E).
At that point, the clinical stage was upgraded to IVB.
After the CT-guided left pleura puncture, pathological IHC analysis showed positive staining for p63, p40, CK 7, and CK 5/6, while TTF-1 and NapsinA staining were absent, supporting a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Fig.2B).
Meanwhile, molecular evaluation confirmed an L858R mutation in exon 21 and a T790M mutation in exon 20 (Fig.4B and C).
Considering the pathology of the SCC was quite distinct compared with that of the originally resected NSCLC specimen, we retrospectively reassessed the surgery specimen to verify our primary diagnosis.
The morphologic and IHC results were in complete agreement with the initial diagnoses, but an L858R mutation was identified using the newly added molecular evaluation (Fig.4A).
To relieve the acute pain in the left pleura as quickly as possible, palliative three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for the chest lesion was delivered at a total dose of 42 Gy/14 fractions (f), once daily and 5f/week (Fig.5).
The volume over radiation dose 5 Gy (V5) values of the left, right, and total lungs were 20%, 0%, and 7.8%, respectively; the volume over radiation dose 20 Gy (V20) values were 10%, 0%, and 5%, respectively; the mean lung dose (MLD) was 5 Gy.
Meanwhile, considering the MST pathology was that of SCC, the patient received GP chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 d1, gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 d1, d8, for 21 days as a cycle) for 4 cycles, and the patient achieved partial remission (PR) after 2 cycles, followed by stable disease (SD) after 4 cycles (Fig.3[B3[B and F] and [C and G]) according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1.
Then, gefitinib (150 mg qd) was used as maintenance treatment from November 2015 onward.
During the treatment, Ibandronate sodium was given monthly for skeletal-related events.
The patient is currently under surveillance with SD (Fig.3D and H) and with PS scores of 0.

"A 44-year-old man had been diagnosed with LCNEC of the thymus with bone metastasis at a different hospital 3 years previously.
The serum levels of ACTH and cortisol were elevated, but brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed that his pituitary gland was normal.
However, immunohistochemical staining of the thymic tumor tissue revealed partial anti-ACTH antibody positivity.
The tumor was therefore determined to be ectopically producing ACTH.
The patient underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin and irinotecan, but the continuation of chemotherapy was problematic due to a lack of tolerance.
Treatment for hypertension and diabetes caused by the ectopic ACTH syndrome was initiated, as was treatment with zoledronic acid for bone metastasis.
The patient was referred to the Endocrine Center at our hospital after 3 months due to a sensation of weakness and the worsening of his hyperglycemia.
A physical examination revealed hypertension, a subcutaneous mass that was palpable in the anterior chest, and redness and swelling of the left lower leg without fever, respiratory symptoms, hypoxemia, or abnormal chest sounds.
The oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter in room air and was 97% and his respiratory rate was 13 breaths per minute.
Among the laboratory findings, the white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and blood sugar, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were found to be elevated, and the patient's potassium level was decreased to 2.8 mEq/L.
The patient's lactate dehydrogenase (468 IU/L), beta-D glucan (370.8 pg/mL), ACTH (354.1 pg/mL), and cortisol (49.1 μg/dL) levels were also elevated.
The patient's serum was negative for aspergillus, candida, and cryptococcus antigens; a cytomegalovirus pp65 antigenemia test also yielded a negative result.
These data suggested that the increased production of ACTH by the tumor, along with the progression of the disease, had promoted the elevation of the patient's serum levels of ACTH and cortisol.
Computed tomography (CT) revealed the progression of the disease in the both thymic and metastatic bone lesions, along with the multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs (Fig.1, ​2).
The patient underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the right B5 segment with 150 mL saline, and 62.7% of the BAL fluid was recovered.
The cell count in the BAL fluid was 0.61×105 per mL, and the cell differentiation in the BAL fluid was 17.0% macrophages, 81.0% lymphocytes, and 2.0% neutrophils, with a CD 4/8 ratio of 0.57.
Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Grocott staining were all negative.
A polymerase chain reaction revealed that the patient's BAL fluid was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii.
PCP was diagnosed based on the above results.
The patient was treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (12 g/day) for 3 weeks.
Anti-cortisol therapy with metyrapone was also initiated at the same time with a small dose to slowly correct the hypercortisolemia.
Intensive insulin therapy, potassium supplementation were initiated, while cefazolin was administered to treat cellulitis of the left lower leg.
The patient's PCP fully improved without the exacerbation of his respiratory status.
Thereafter, we continued to administer sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim at a prophylactic dose.
The metyrapone dosage was gradually increased from 250 mg/day, and the blood cortisol value was observed to decline slowly (Fig.3).
In order to prevent hypocortisolemia, the patient was temporarily treated with hydrocortisone.
After an improvement of his left lower leg cellulitis, PCP, and hyperglycemia, the patient underwent laminectomy and radiation therapy for spinal cord compression, which had been caused by a metastatic spinal tumor.
Octreotide therapy was initiated, and he was discharged on the 68th day of hospitalization.

"A 78-year-old previously healthy male heavy smoker presented at the Emergency Department with generalized jaundice (sclera and skin), ascites, and hepatic coma.
The relatives declared that he was known to have a urinary bladder carcinoma that was diagnosed at a routine control performed 3 months before but no medical papers to prove this diagnosis were shown.
They also mentioned a 2-month history of progressive jaundice, somnolence, and temporary loss of consciousness.
No weight loss or other clinical signs were mentioned.
No previously viral hepatitis or drug excess was reported.
No family history of cancer was declared.
At the present admission, the abdominal CT scan showed marked hepatomegaly with multiple small nodules (2–10 mm in diameter) that was supposed to be hepatic metastases from the bladder carcinoma.
The thoracic x-ray showed a bilateral bronchopneumonia without abnormal opacities.
The patient died with hepatic encephalopathy at 7 hours after admission.
Prior to the autopsy, signed informed consent of the relatives was obtained for the case publication.
Being about a case report, no Ethical Committee approval was necessary.
At autopsy, the macroscopic examination showed a huge liver (6.5 kg) with widely distributed white nodules of varying sizes (Fig.1).
The urinary bladder was not modified, but a 30 × 30 × 50 mm prostate nodule with infiltrative aspect was observed (Fig.2).
The bilateral bronchopneumonia was confirmed, without any central tumor mass.
A 10-mm white nodule was identified encasing a small bronchus from the middle lobe of the right lung, without peripheral nodules (Fig.3).
Except for moderate edema, no other brain lesions were identified.
The other organs did not show modifications.
The tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin together with iliac crest bone grafting.
Microscopic examination of the prostate showed a 3+3 Gleason's grade 2 occult adenocarcinoma (Fig.2).
Clusters and sheets of small round cells were seen in the liver parenchyma (Fig.1) and the lymph nodes from the hepatic hilum.
Examination of the lung parenchyma showed a peribronchial SCLC with multiple tumor emboli in both veins and lymphatic vessels and multiple “coin-shaped” tumor nodules of 1 to 2 mm in diameter below the pleura (Fig.3).
The small round tumor cells were also seen in bone marrow from the iliac crest bone (Fig.3).
No brain metastases have been detected.
Based on the macro- and microscopic features and clinical picture, the final diagnosis was “peribronchial and coin-like peripheral SCLC with massive angiolymphatic invasion and metastases in the lymph nodes, liver and bone, associated with encephalopathy and synchronous occult adenocarcinoma of the prostate.”

"A 49-year-old woman was admitted to the Department of Radiology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University in October 2004 with right upper quadrant pain and weight loss.
She was a hepatitis B virus carrier.
Her α-fetoprotein level was 1185.3 ng/mL.
Ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) revealed a 10-cm mass in the posterior segments of the right liver lobe.
A 1.5-cm mass was also found in the left lateral segment.
These clinical signs indicated that the patient had inoperable HCC and Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis.
TACE was offered to the patient.
Angiogram demonstrated no obvious hepatic arterio-venous shunt, but multiple smaller masses in both lobes of the liver.
An emulsion of oxaliplatin, pirarubicin, hydroxycamptothecin and lipiodol were prepared, 35 mL and 3 mL of the mixture were administered intra-arterially to the right and left hepatic artery, respectively.
The patient experienced right upper quadrant pain after TACE and had an uneventful recovery.
One month later, a second TACE procedure was performed via the right hepatic artery and 40 mL of the mixture was administered.
On the next day, she experienced sudden acute dyspnoea and the peripheral oxygen saturation decreased to 90%.
The chest X-ray showed some increased reticular shadows in the left lung, especially in the lower zones, and a chest CT scan revealed multiple iodized oil-like high-density materials in parenchyma of the lung (Figure ​1).
After 10 mg dexamethasone i.v. and other supportive therapies were administered, the respiratory symptom was attenuated.
Two days later, the patient suffered from a serious headache and transient consciousness loss, accompanying nausea and vomiting followed by confusion, lower extremity weakness.
Non-contrast enhanced CT scanning showed multiple disseminated hyper-intense lesions in the brain, consistent with deposition of iodized oil (Figure ​2).
One week later, her respiratory and neurologic symptoms disappeared completely, and she was discharged.
The patient also consequently completed the other three TACE procedures, during which no similar symptoms occurred.

"A 46-year-old woman with a history of Graves' disease (GD) was transferred to our emergency department on suspicion of DKA.
She had noticed polydipsia, polyuria, and fatigue approximately four months prior to admission.
She had also been suffering from a 1-month complaint of appetite loss, approximately 7 kg weight loss, fatigue, nausea, and sweating.
Her medical history included GD, diagnosed at 42 years of age and managed with methimazole.
However, she had poor compliance with anti-thyroid drugs.
She denied a family history of thyroid diseases or diabetes.
Three days before admission, she was also diagnosed with influenza A at a nearby hospital, and oseltamivir phosphate was prescribed.
At the emergency department, she presented with drowsiness and a body temperature of 37.0℃, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, heart rate of 200 bpm, respiratory rate of 32 breaths/min, oxygen saturation of 99% in 5 L nasal air, and a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score of 14.
Her clinical examination revealed a diffuse goiter with bilateral exophthalmoses.
Her lungs were clear when auscultated.
Her abdomen was soft and non-tender.
Her skin was warm and wet.
She had no lower extremity edema.
The electrocardiogram showed marked tachycardia with atrial fibrillation, and a chest radiograph was normal.
The laboratory data are shown in Table 1.
Her initial laboratory data demonstrated marked metabolic acidosis, an increased plasma glucose level of 472 mg/dL, an increased HbA1c level of 13.7%, an increased free triiodothyronine level of 6.440 pg/mL, and a free thyroxine level of 2.830 ng/dL, with a suppressed thyrotropin (TSH) level of 0.005 μIU/mL.
She scored 55 on the diagnostic criteria of Burch & Wartofsky for thyroid storm, and the diagnostic criteria of the Japan Thyroid Association for thyroid storm were also satisfied, since she had thyrotoxicosis, symptoms involving the central nervous system, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal symptoms (4).
Accordingly, she was diagnosed with DKA and thyroid storm and admitted to the medical intensive care unit for further monitoring and treatment.
The clinical course is shown in Figure.
She was treated with an intravenous insulin drip and aggressive intravenous fluid therapy.
The thyroid storm with GD was treated with intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours, oral potassium iodine 50 mg every 6 hours, and oral methimazole 20 mg every 6 hours.
Since she had a history of asthma, landiolol hydrochloride, a short-acting beta-adrenoceptor blocker, was used at 4-12 μg/kg/min to control her heart rate.
By Day 3, her tachycardia had resolved, and landiolol hydrochloride was discontinued.
On Day 6, the white blood cell count had decreased to 2,800 cells/mm3 [neutrophils, 44.2% (1,238 cells/mm3)].
Methimazole was discontinued because methimazole-induced neutropenia was suspected.
The patient was referred to an endocrine surgeon, and thyroidectomy was performed on Day 32.
She was discharged from the hospital on Day 37 and maintained on multiple daily insulin infusion and levothyroxine sodium hydrate.
Further immunological investigation revealed elevated levels of anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibody, anti-insulinoma antigen 2 (IA-2) antibody, and insulin autoantibody, consistent with T1D.
The intravenous glucagon stimulation test was performed with blood samples for glucose and C-peptide taken at baseline and 6 minutes.
Her plasma glucose levels were 139 and 152 mg/dL at baseline and 6 minutes, respectively.
The corresponding serum C-peptide levels were 0.8 and 1.3 ng/mL at baseline and 6 minutes, respectively.
"
"A 13 year-old boy presented with a 1 month history of intermittent episodes of small volume epistaxis.
There was no significant past medical, surgical or family history.
Physical examination revealed a left palatal fleshy mass centered at left posterior molars.
A nasoendoscopic examination demonstrated a large swelling on the floor of left anterior nasal space, involving the left inferior meatus and abutting the inferior turbinate.
Computed Tomography (CT) of the paranasal sinuses showed a lobulated, expansile lytic lesion of left maxilla [Fig 1] with a lucent center and peripheral calcifications.
The lesion was associated with a large soft tissue component that demonstrated mild heterogeneous contrast enhancement.
The lesion was centered at the left maxillary alveolus, involving the left hard palate, inferior part of the anterior left maxillary wall and medial left maxillary wall.
The lesion also involved the roots of the left maxillary molars and pre-molars and was abutting the left orbital floor, with no gross orbital invasion.
The patient subsequently underwent 18-FDG PET-CT study.
The mass centered in left maxilla was hypermetabolic, with index SUVmax 9.7 [Fig 2].
There was no FDG-avid metastatic disease.
A trans-oral incisional biopsy of the left palatal mass was performed and was suggestive of a preliminary diagnosis of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, as evidenced by a biphasic pattern featuring sheets of small round cells with hemangiopericytoma-like vascular pattern and mature cartilaginous islands.
The patient underwent left subtotal maxillectomy via lateral rhinotomy and translabial approach.
The final histology was conclusive of a 5cm high-grade (Grade 3) mesenchymal chondrosarcoma.
One of the resection margins was positive for tumor involvement and the patient was planned for adjuvant chemotherapy.

"Our patient was a 68-year-old woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
She had no history of gastroesophageal reflux disease or esophageal disorders but was found to have a progressive solitary pulmonary nodule (1×1.3cm).
A right lower wedge resection was performed in December 2011 and the University of Iowa pathology department identified the tumor as a LCNEC.
Approximately six months after her operation, our patient started having slowly progressing dysphagia for both solids and liquids.
A positron emission tomography (PET) scan performed in 2012, one year post surgery, was unremarkable for recurrence or metastasis.
Repeat computed tomography (CT) in June 2013 (18 months post surgery) did not show any recurrence (Figure 1).
Our patient had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and barium swallow that revealed no stricture of her esophagus but failure of primary and secondary peristaltic waves and reflux.
In July 2013, esophageal manometry found failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax, with a residual pressure of 32mmHg.
Our patient was treated with calcium channel blockers with partial relief.
Thus far, up to 18 months post resection, our patient had been able to maintain her weight and her basic laboratory parameters, including hemoglobin, albumin and cholesterol levels.
However, in January 2014, she reported worsening dysphagia and weight loss of 10lbs over a period of one month.
She was referred to our center for further treatment of her achalasia.
A repeat esophageal manometry showed an elevated lower esophageal sphincter pressure of 50mmHg as well non-propagative, non-peristaltic contractions throughout her esophageal musculature (Figure 2).
A repeat EGD with an intention to perform therapeutic pneumatic dilation showed a nearly circumferential ulcerated, fungating mass from approximately 36cm that extended to her gastroesophageal junction at 39cm.
Biopsies revealed a LCNEC with similar features to the primary tumor resected in 2011, and was concluded to be a metastasis.
Subsequently, a repeat CT scan revealed progressive diffuse metastatic disease.
Our patient underwent two courses of chemotherapy but died from the disease after six months.

"A 54-year-old Asian man with IgA nephropathy underwent living-donor kidney transplantation 14 years previously.
His medical condition had been almost stable for 14 years.
He developed multifocal salmon-pink skin discoloration, and swelling and spontaneous pain in the left knee and leg.
The symptoms had gradually expanded across the right forearm and outside of the right thigh.
He was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of fever (39 °C) and multifocal cellulitis (Fig.1).
Two months before admission, he had developed chronic diarrhea.
His serum creatinine level was stabilized at 1.7 mg/dL with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy comprising tacrolimus (3 mg/day), mycophenolate mofetil (1500 mg/day), and prednisone (4 mg every other day).
The tacrolimus trough concentration was 6.3 ng/mL.
The patient had been a dog breeder for 12 years.
On admission, his white blood cell count was 12,400/μL and his C-reactive protein level was 3.9 mg/dL.
The patient was initially treated with ampicillin/sulbactam (9 g/day intravenously).
Two days after the initiation of this therapy, he was afebrile.
Four days later, an automated blood culture (Bactec FX®; Becton–Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD, USA) showed positivity for gram-negative spiral bacilli.
A colony obtained from the patient’s blood culture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Biotyper ver. 3.0®; Bruker Corporation, Germany).
The identification score was 2.064 (>2.0), indicating accurate identification of H. cinaedi (Fig.2).
Additional evaluation of the patient’s blood specifically for H.
cinaedi by means of gyrase subunit B (gyrB)-targeted PCR assays (using the forward primer AGGGATTCCACAAAGTGAGC and the reverse primer TCTTGTCCTGTGCGTTCATC to amplify the region of the gyrB gene) yielded positive results.
We performed gyrB-targeted PCR using a single colony isolated from a blood culture.
We used distilled water (DNA- and DNase-free water) as a negative control to prevent contamination of gyrB-targeted PCR (Fig.3).
In addition, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of this strain, and the results were > 99% consistent with the existing sequence (Fig.4).
Given these results, we diagnosed the patient with H.
cinaedi bacteremia with cellulitis.
We examined the genomic heat shock protein (HSP) 60 sequence of the blood culture isolate, which resulted in identification of cluster B H. cinaedi.
A blood culture obtained at 11 days was positive for H.
cinaedi, but a culture obtained at 15 days was negative.
The patient’s cellulitis gradually resolved.
The patient continued antibiotic treatment for a total of 6 weeks (ampicillin-sulbactam in a drip for 2 weeks and oral levofloxacin for 4 weeks), and he had no recurrence 6 months after this therapy.
His stool culture was negative, although it was taken after treatment.
We did not apply enteric bacteria elimination in this case.

"The 31-year-old white primipara with twin pregnancy was admitted to hospital in the 38th week of gestation with elevated blood pressure (150/100 mmHg).
After receiving antihypertensive treatment blood pressure was 120/80.
All laboratory variables, including plasma proteins, were within their respective reference intervals.
Few hours after admission to the hospital the contractions started, and the caesarean section was performed because of vertex-transverse presentation of twins.
Liveborn female and male were delivered.
The postoperative course was initially inconspicuous.
Four hours postpartum she experienced sudden epigastric pain.
The blood pressure rose to 190/130.
Laboratory findings showed haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and an increase in serum creatinine and aminotransferases (Table I).
Intravenous magnesium sulphate was administered.
Abdominal ultrasound disclosed an empty uterine cavity without placenta residue.
Five hours postpartum, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit because of poor urine output, drowsiness, and suspicion of DIC.
On examination she was sleepy and disoriented.
The combination of haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes suggested a postpartum HELLP syndrome, complicated by DIC.
The patient was rehydrated, and treatment was instituted with fresh frozen plasma, red cell transfusion, fresh platelets, and kybernin P (antithrombin III).
High serum urea, creatinine, and persistent anuria were compatible with acute renal failure.
A high dose of furosemide failed to increase diuresis.
Sixteen hours postpartum her blood pressure was 60/40 and oxygen saturation 70%.
Few minutes later the patient had acute cardiac arrest, and resuscitation started.
Resuscitation was successful, and normal heart action was re-established; blood pressure rose to 150/110, and oxygen saturation was 90%.
Laboratory findings were deteriorated, and development of acute renal failure indicated the necessity of urgent dialysis.
Following dialysis, the patient was stable, oxygen saturation 98%.
Twenty hours postpartum patient developed again cardiopulmonary arrest.
Despite resuscitation attempts the outcome was lethal.
Due to the fact that death occurred in the hospital a short time after a surgical intervention, a medico-legal autopsy was ordered.
An autopsy revealed oedema of the brain and lungs as well as dilatation of right and left ventricles.
Hydrothorax (900 mL), hydroperitoneum (2500 mL), and hydropericardium (200 mL) were present.
The field of operation of the caesarean section was unremarkable.
Petechial and suffusional haemorrhages were observed under the pleura, endocardium, in the mucosae of the renal pelvis, and peritoneum of the small and large bowel.
Histology revealed periportal hepatocellular necrosis, bloodless glomeruli with swollen and vacuolated intracapillary cells, as well as confluent haemorrhages in kidneys, liver, and spleen.
Death was attributed to multiple organ failure due to DIC as a consequence of HELLP syndrome.
"
"A 61-year-old male was referred to the emergency department by his general practitioner in April 2010 for investigation of loose bowel motions and an episode of black stool.
The patient had a history of insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease with two previous ischaemic events, obstructive sleep apnoea, depression, schizophrenia and a previous incisional hernia repair.
On examination, he was morbidly obese (BMI 45) and was noted to have marked hepatomegaly.
This was not associated with any recent weight loss, haematemesis, jaundice or abdominal pain.
The patient denied previous blood transfusions, usage of intravenous drugs and did not drink alcohol.
A faecal occult blood test was negative, and the patient’s last colonoscopy 2 years prior was unremarkable.
He was referred to our tertiary centre for further management after an ultrasound scan (USS) displayed an ovoid mass of mixed echogenicity arising from the liver, measuring 12 × 9 cm.
A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a malignant appearing, pedunculated lesion attached to segment IV (Fig.1).
A subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed that on T2 weighted imaging (WI), the lesion was isointense to the liver peripherally with central branching hyperintensities (Fig.2a) which corresponded to the hypointensities seen on T1WI (Fig.2b).
Enhancement of the lesion was noted in arterial phase (Fig.3a), during portal venous phase (Fig.3b) and at 2 min (Fig.3c), with some central areas of non-enhancement.
The lesion becomes slightly hypointense on delayed images at 10 (Fig.3d) and 20 min compared to the surrounding liver.
Laboratory investigations revealed a mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase of 137 IU/L (normal 5–50 IU/L).
Hepatitis screen, alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19–9 were all unremarkable.
The patient underwent a subsegmental resection of the 15 cm segment IVb mass in June 2010.
There was severe hepatic steatosis, but no cirrhosis.
The patient was discharged postoperative day seven without complications.
Pathology of the resection specimen confirmed SFTL.
The specimen displayed a pale tan nodular appearance with a firm and rubbery cut surface.
Histological examination revealed fascicles of spindle cells in storiform arrangement with a pushing margin.
There was evidence of extracellular collagen deposition, areas of myxoid stroma and branching vessels with hyalinisation.
The specimen displayed a high mitotic rate of up to 9 per 10 high-power fields (HPF) with no necrotic or haemorrhagic features.
Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for CD34, CD99 and BCL-2.
The tumour was negative for c-Kit, CD31, SMA, desmin, cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, MNF116 and Cam 5.2), EMA and S100.
The margins were clear.
The non-neoplastic remainder of the liver displayed pericellular fibrosis indicative of steatohepatitis.
The patient was followed-up regularly every 4 to 6 months with CT scans by the local general practitioner who liaised with the consultant surgeon.
There were two episodes of re-admissions for further investigation of recurrent right upper quadrant pain between 2011 and 2013.
Multiple MRI scans performed during this period revealed expected postsurgical changes with no tumour recurrence.
However, in May 2016, the patient presented to his local emergency department with progressively worsening right upper quadrant pain and increasing dyspnoea with an oxygen demand.
CT of his chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed extensive tumour recurrence adjacent to the previous resection site (Fig.4).
In addition, there was a clinically significant right-sided pleural effusion and a pleural mass at the right lung base measuring 3.8 cm (Fig.5).
Pleurocentesis was performed, draining 1400 ml of serosanguineous fluid.
Cytology was negative for malignant cells.
The case was discussed extensively in a multi-disciplinary setting, and it was decided given the patient’s two sites of disease and significant perioperative risk that he was not a candidate for radical reoperation.
There were also no suitable chemo- or radiotherapeutic therapies available.
The patient was subsequently referred to the palliative team for management of his symptoms and discharged back to the community.
He was still alive 1 month after discharge.
"
"A 63-year-old woman with no known cardiac history presented with a sudden onset of dyspnea requiring intubation and ventilatory support out of hospital.
She denied preceding symptoms of chest discomfort, palpitations, syncope or infection.
The patient was afebrile and normotensive, with a sinus tachycardia of 140 beats/min.
The cardiorespiratory examination was remarkable for an elevated jugular venous pressure at the angle of the jaw, a left-sided third heart sound and bibasilar crackles in both lung fields.
The complete blood cell count, electrolytes and cardiac biomarkers were within normal limits.
An initial electrocardiogram revealed ST depression in leads V2 to V6, suggestive of anterolateral ischemia (Figure 1).
A chest radiograph demonstrated pulmonary vascular congestion consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary edema (Figure 2).
An echocardiographic examination revealed normal cardiac dimensions, normal wall motion and mild diastolic dysfunction with an early diastolic to late diastolic transmitral ratio of less than 1, prolonged deceleration time (250 ms) and a reduced early diastolic annular velocity of the lateral mitral valve annulus.
Following aggressive diuresis and requiring minimal ventilatory support, the patient was extubated one day following her initial presentation.
Within 1 h of extubation, the patient developed recurrent pulmonary edema clinically and radiographically, requiring mechanical ventilation.
Cardiac catheterization was performed and revealed normal coronary arteries.
On day 4 of the coronary care unit admission, the patient failed a repeat attempt at extubation.
A computed tomographic scan revealed a 4 cm × 9 cm multinodular goiter extending into the mediastinum and suspected associated tracheal stenosis (Figure 3).
With a diagnosis of NPPE secondary to an enlarged goiter, the patient underwent surgical intervention for a thyroidectomy.
Intraoperative bronchoscopy revealed tracheal stenosis of greater than 50%.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated, and three months following discharge, the patient returned to her previous activity level without subjective dyspnea.
"
"A 25-year-old female patient had noticed left-sided visual loss and amenorrhea 2 years prior to being seen, with right hemiparesis developing 6 months beforehand.
Aggravated symptoms (drooping at corner of right lip and bilateral temporal hemianopia) finally prompted hospitalization.
At that time, a massive (>5 cm) tumor of intra- and suprasellar location, excluding mesencephalon backward, was seen on computerized tomography (CT) of the head (Fig.1a).
Further testing revealed an exceedingly high-serum level of prolactin (PRL) (4408 ng/ml), whereas levels of all other pituitary hormones were within reference ranges (growth hormone (GH), 0.50 ng/ml; luteinizing hormone (LH), 2.60 mIU/ml; follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 4.57 mIU/ml; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 37.4 pg/ml; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 2.68 μIU/ml).
T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with contrast (gadolinium) showed homogeneous tumor enhancement, but adjacent tissue was not edematous in T2-weighted views.
The mass did not regress, despite a 4-week course of the dopamine analog, cabergoline (1 mg/week), and serum PRL level (2207 ng/ml) remained elevated.
Relative to status at admission, the right lateral ventricle also had enlarged somewhat, due to obstruction at foramen of Monro (Fig.1b).
In light of this intransigence, surgical debulking of tumor was elected first, through craniotomy and then via transsphenoidal approach.
The hardened elastic quality of the tumor and its strong attachments to neighboring structures prevented complete removal, but related mass effect was significantly reduced and serum PRL level declined (to 250 ng/ml) in steps at each procedural stage.
But the normalization of PRL level had not been achieved with the administration of cabergoline increased up to 0.5 mg/day.
The residual tumor showed no evidence of regrowth or distant metastasis 1 year after surgery.
Histopathologically, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of specimens from the first and second surgical procedures similarly were composed of polygonal and spindle cells with round, oval, or elongated nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm (Fig.2a–c).
The cells formed irregular nests or short fascicles, accompanied by frequent hyaline changes in vessel walls and vacuolation (Fig.2d).
Some nuclear pleomorphism was prominent; on the other hand, neither a high mitotic rate nor necrosis was evident (Fig.2b, c).
Conspicuous fibrous change of tumor stroma was noted focally as well (Fig.3a).
The chromophobic nature of tumor cells was confirmed by Pearse’s Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain (Fig.3b).
Immunostains showed strong diffuse positivity for PRL (Fig.3c), chromogranin-A, and synaptophysin.
No other hormones (GH, TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH) were expressed by tumor cells, and the other markers, including S-100 protein (Fig.3d), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (CK AE1/AE3), vimentin, p53, and bcl-2, were also negative by immunostaining.
Ki-67 labeling index was approximately 2 %.
A final diagnosis of PRL-producing pituitary adenoma was reached after considering the immunohistochemical profile, suprasellar location, and prolactin production of the tumor, as well as the absence of metastatic foci and invasion into surrounding tissue.

"A 54-year-old woman with stage IV NSCLC was treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel without disease response.
Molecular analysis of tumor tissue was unavailable at that time.
However, her demographic profile (Asian, minimal smoking history, non-small cell histology) predicted her disease would harbor EGFR TKI sensitive cells [2].
Therefore, she then initiated standard daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg) and her disease responded.
Twenty-eight months later, she acquired resistance to erlotinib with progression of disease systemically.
Following further progression through an experimental angiogenesis inhibitor, she initiated pemetrexed and resumed standard dose erlotinib.
After initial response, 11 months later, her disease again progressed.
DNA was extracted from biopsy of a progressing lung lesion and examined using established techniques for analysis of EGFR mutations [5].
Direct sequencing of exons 18–21 encoding the kinase domain of EGFR revealed the L858R mutation associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (Fig.1) [2].
It also demonstrated the T790M mutation associated with acquired EGFR TKI resistance (Fig.1) [2].
She also developed headaches and there was a high clinical suspicion of CNS metastases despite negative imaging (not shown).
She refused a lumbar puncture.
She initiated empiric temozolomide plus standard dose erlotinib (150 mg daily) for presumed CNS disease, but after one cycle her headaches worsened, and she developed nausea and vomiting concerning for CNS metastases with associated raised intracranial pressure.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain now demonstrated LM (Fig.2) confirmed by CSF cytology (not shown).
By direct sequencing, DNA from CSF cells harbored L858R predicting EGFR TKI sensitivity (Fig.3, left panel) but not the T790M resistance mutation (data not shown).
Because the result for T790M was negative in this sample, we performed a more sensitive fluorescence detection PCR-based assay that takes advantage of a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism generated by the specific missense mutation (Fig.3, right panel, arrow, positive control) [6].
That result was also negative, as only the wild type peak was detected (Fig.3, right panel, bottom).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the LM remained sensitive to an EGFR TKI if sufficiently high concentrations of drug could be achieved in the CSF.
The erlotinib concentration required to inhibit growth of cell lines harboring L858R by 50% (IC50) is 100 nM (nM) [2].
Standard dose erlotinib (150 mg daily) achieves 3000 nM in plasma [7], but CSF concentrations of EGFR TKIs are as low as 1% plasma levels below the IC50 [3, 8].
Increasing the daily dose of gefitinib to enhance CSF penetration has been an effective strategy [3], but gefitinib is no longer available in the United States following failure in phase III NSCLC trials.
An analogous increase of the daily erlotinib dose above 150–200 mg daily induces unacceptable toxicity.
However, weekly high-dose erlotinib up to 2000 mg is tolerable [4].
Pharmacokinetic analysis of CSF from another patient with NSCLC LM (not shown) treated with 1500 mg erlotinib weekly demonstrated a peak plasma concentration of 11,300 nM with a concurrent CSF concentration of 130 nM.
Therefore, such high dose weekly administration of erlotinib achieved a CSF concentration exceeding the IC50.
Therefore, to increase CSF penetrance over standard daily erlotinib dosing in this patient, we initiated high-dose weekly erlotinib at 1000 mg then 1200 mg; persistent nausea precluded higher doses.
Pharmacokinetic analysis was not undertaken in this patient.
After 1 month there was a partial radiographic response of LM on brain MRI (Fig.2b) and after 2 months in the cauda equina (not shown).
However, hydrocephalus and persistent symptoms referable to increased intracranial pressure led to a VP shunt and whole-brain radiation therapy, after which she resumed treatment with 1500 mg weekly erlotinib.
One month later, progressive intra-thoracic disease led to initiation of cetixumab and erlotinib was continued but changed to low dose (100 mg) daily.
She survived 14 months following the diagnosis of CNS disease.

"A 22-year-old Tibetan man without significant past medical history was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in a routine medical examination and received anti-TB therapy that included isoniazid (INH, 300 mg/d), RMP (450 mg/d), ethambutol (EMB, 750 mg/d), and pyrazinamide (PZA, 1500 mg/d).
After 1 week of continuous therapy, he was admitted to the Tibet People's Hospital with nasal hemorrhage and the platelet (PLT) count was 0.4 × 109/L (normal range, 100–300 × 109/L).
Epistaxis was cured after symptomatic treatment.
Two days later, he developed hematochezia, hematuria, and purpura, and required transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma and platelets in another local hospital.
Four days later (November 18, 2015), he was transferred to the West China Hospital due to the ineffective treatment.
On physical examination, he presented with pallor, mild jaundice on the sclera, purpura, tachycardia (heart rate 132/min) and weak breath sounds at the base of the left lung.
Laboratory results on admission indicated DIC: prothrombin time (17.8 seconds; normal range, 9.6–12.8 seconds), international normalized ratio (1.53; normal range, 0.88–1.15), fibrinogen (1.13 g/L; normal range, 2.0–4.0 g/L), D-dimers (23.45 mg/L; normal range, <0.55 mg/L), fibrin degradation product (60.4 mg/L; normal range,<5 mg/L), and PLT (2 × 109/L; normal range, 100–300 × 109/L).
Other abnormal data were as follows: white blood cell (WBC, 48.38 × 109/L; normal range, 3.5–9.5), hemoglobin (65 g/L; normal range, 130–175 g/L), total bilirubin (30.8 umol/L; normal range, 5.0–28.0 umol/L), direct bilirubin (16.6 umol/L; normal range, < 8.8 umol/L), aspartate aminotransferase (75 U/L; normal range, <40 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (293 U/L; normal range, <50 U/L), lactate dehydrogenase (380 U/L; normal range, 110–220 U/L), serum urea nitrogen (13.01 mmol/L; normal range, 3.2–7.79 mmol/L), C-reactive protein (16.70 mg/L; normal range, <5 mg/L), complement 3 (0.41 g/L; normal range, 0.785–1.520 g/L), and complement 4 (0.0797 g/L; normal range, 0.145–0.360 g/L).
Routine urine test showed blood cell >330 Cell/uL, leukocyte 250 Cell/uL, protein 2 g/L, and urobilinogen 70 umol/L.
Routine stool test showed red blood cell 4+/HP, white blood cell 1+/HP, occult blood test (+).
T-SPOT result was positive.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis for mycobacterium TB on sputum was positive.
Acid fast stain test of a sputum smear was negative.
Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission (November 18, 2015) (Fig.1) showed infiltrates on the upper lobe of the left lung, left pleural effusion, and pericardial effusion, accompanied by enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a small amount of fluid adjacent to the liver and spleen.
Serologic markers were negative for acute or chronic viral hepatitis, HIV, direct Coomb test, and autoimmune hepatitis.
Peripheral blood film and culture were negative.
Bone marrow smear and medulloculture were also negative.
The antituberculosis drugs were discontinued immediately after admission.
Besides fasting, he was initiated with infusion of fresh-frozen plasma, platelet, packed red blood cells, intravenous immune globulin, recombinant human thrombopoietin, omeprazole, and polyene phosphatidylcholine as well as nutrition supportive treatment.
Five days after fasting (November 23, 2015), the patient started a therapy consisting of EMB, moxifloxacin, and amikacin, while he had no further active hemorrhage.
Eight days after admission (November 26, 2015), the platelet counts had risen gradually.
INH (200 mg/d, intravenously guttae) was administered on 24 days after admission (December 11, 2015), while his liver function tests and platelet counts returned to normal.
The main laboratory features are summarized in Table 1.
One month later (December 17, 2015), reviewed chest CT (Fig.1) indicated the infiltration, hydrothorax, and pericardial effusion were absorbed well.
Almost about 4 weeks after admission, the patient recovered and left hospital with INH (300 mg/d), EMB (750 mg/d), levofloxacin (500 mg/d), and streptomycin (750,000 U/d, intramuscular injection).
There was no recurrence of DIC or hemorrhage during 8 months of follow-up.
Unfortunately, the patient refused a follow-up chest CT after his discharge.
Table ​2 shows the timeline of this case.

"A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to our Department for a thyroid nodule on the right side of the neck, which was incidentally detected on carotid Doppler ultrasound scan.
Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) showed a follicular lesion.
At the time of our evaluation, the patient was in good health.
The medical history revealed hypertension, vitiligo, and celiac disease.
On physical examination, a small nodule (1 cm) was palpable in the right thyroid lobe.
No enlarged neck lymph nodes were palpable.
Neck ultrasound showed a 1.3 cm hypoechoic nodule with irregular margins in the right thyroid lobe together with bilateral small thyroid nodules (4–5 mm) and the absence of enlarged cervical bilateral lymph nodes.
Thyroid function tests were normal with the absence of thyroid autoantibodies.
Serum calcium was normal (9.7 mg/dl; normal range, 8.4–10.4 mg/dL) and PTH, routinely measured together with serum calcium in our Center in patients undergoing thyroid surgery, slightly elevated (68 pg/mL (intact PTH, 2nd generation assay; normal range, 10–65 pg/mL)).
The re-review of the original slides of FNAC confirmed a follicular lesion.
In particular, the cytology of the nodule showed epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei organized in small cohesive clusters resembling microfollicles typically observed in thyroid follicular lesions were evident (Fig.1a).
The patients underwent right lobectomy.
During neck exploration, there were no macroscopic signs of local invasion.
The intraoperative frozen-section pathological examination raised the suspicion of a PC.
Definitive histology showed a markedly irregular infiltrative growth of the tumor with invasion of the thyroid tissue and cervical soft tissues (Fig.1b, c).
Immunostaining for thyroglobulin was negative, whereas staining for chromogranin A and PTH showed a strong reactivity (Fig.1d–f).
Based on the light microscopic findings and the immunohistochemical profile, the tumor was diagnosed as a PC.
Postoperative serum calcium (8.7 mg/dl) and phosphate (3 mg/dl) levels were in the normal range.
One month after surgery, serum calcium and plasma PTH were 9.6 mg/dL and 47 pg/mL, respectively.
Neck ultrasound and total body computed tomography scan were negative for local and metastatic disease.
Eight months later, serum calcium and plasma PTH levels were 9.1–9.2 mg/dl and 38–44 pg/ml (1–84 PTH 3rd generation assay, normal range, 8–40 pg/mL), respectively.
Neck ultrasound did not show any pathological lesions.
In order to exclude a familiar form of PHPT, in which PC may rarely occur as a nonfunctioning tumor [11], the screening of serum calcium and neck ultrasound in the first-degree relatives was normal.

"A 67-year-old Japanese female presented with a left buttock tumor, which had been first detected approximately 1 year earlier, and had recently gradually enlarged.
Physical examination revealed a relatively well-circumscribed skin-colored tumor with hyperkeratosis, measuring 43 x 38 mm in diameter, in her left buttock.
The biopsy specimen revealed Bowen’s disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ), and subsequently, total resection of the tumor was performed.
Histopathological study of the resected specimen revealed proliferation of atypical squamous cells in the entire layer of the acanthotic epidermis accompanied by hyperparakeratosis (Figure 1A).
These atypical squamous cells had enlarged and hyperchromatic nuclei (Figure 1B), and multinucleated atypical squamous cells were also present.
Mitotic figures were scattered and present in the upper portion of the epidermis.
Atypical mitotic figures were also observed (Figure 1B).
No invasive neoplastic growth was noted (Figure 1A).
Approximately 95% of the lesion was composed of the above-mentioned Bowen’s disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ), and superficial sebaceous carcinoma was present in the central area of the lesion.
This latter component was composed of proliferation of nests of atypical cells with vacuolated clear cytoplasm and large nuclei containing conspicuous nucleoli (Figure 1C, ​,1D).1D).
Sebaceous carcinoma had invaded into the superficial reticular dermis (Figure 1C).
Moreover, atypical cells containing vacuolated cytoplasm were present within the lesion of Bowen’s disease adjacent to the sebaceous carcinoma (Figure 1E).
Immunohistochemical studies were performed using an autostainer (Ventana) by the same method as previously reported [9-12].
Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin 7, and adipophilin were expressed in the sebaceous carcinoma component, but not in Bowen’s disease (Figure 2A).
Androgen receptor was also expressed in some of the tumor cells of the sebaceous carcinoma, but not in Bowen’s disease.
Moreover, atypical vacuolated cells within the lesion of Bowen’s disease were also positive for adipophilin (Figure 2B).
Overexpression of p53 protein was observed in both the sebaceous carcinoma and Bowen’s disease.
Accordingly, an ultimate diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma associated with Bowen’s disease was made.

"The patient was a 34-yr-old man who presented with complaints of fever and a chronic cough.
He was a smoker and had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis that had been treated and cured.
A computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed multiple tiny nodules in both lungs.
A thoracoscopic lung biopsy was taken from the right upper lobe.
The microscopic examination revealed a typical LCH.
The tumor cells had vesicular and grooved nuclei, and they formed small aggregations around the bronchioles (Fig.1).
The tumor cells were strongly positive for S-100 protein, vimentin, CD68 and CD1a.
There were infiltrations of lymphocytes and eosinophils around the tumor cells.
With performing additional radiologic examinations, no other organs were thought to be involved.
He quit smoking, but he received no other specific treatment.
He was well for the following one year.
After this, a follow-up CT scan was performed and it showed a 4 cm-sized mass in the left lower lobe, in addition to the multiple tiny nodules in both lungs (Fig.2).
A needle biopsy specimen revealed the possibility of a sarcoma; therefore, a lobectomy was performed.
Grossly, a 4 cm-sized poorly-circumscribed lobulated gray-white mass was found (Fig.3), and there were a few small satellite nodules around the main mass.
Microscopically, the tumor cells were aggregated in large sheets and they showed an infiltrative growth.
The cytologic features of some of the tumor cells were similar to those seen in a typical LCH.
However, many tumor cells showed overtly malignant cytologic features such as pleomorphic/hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli (Fig.4), and multinucleated tumor giant cells were also found.
There were numerous mitotic figures ranging from 30 to 60 per 10 high power fields, and some of them were abnormal.
A few foci of typical LCH remained around the main tumor mass.
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly positive for S-100 protein (Fig.5) and vimentin; they were also positive for CD68 (Dako N1577, Clone KPI), and focally positive for CD1a (Fig.6), and they were negative for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, CD3, CD20 and HMB45.
The ultrastructural analysis failed to demonstrate any Birbeck granules in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells.
Now, at five months after lobectomy, the patient is doing well with no significant change in the radiologic findings.

"We present the case of a 22-year-old woman who was diagnosed in childhood with type IIb VHL, with known multiple retinal angiomas, pancreatic cysts, and spinal and cerebellar hemangioblastomas.
She was admitted to our hospital complaining of progressive dyspnea and palpitations.
On examination, her blood pressure was 159/119 mm Hg and her pulse was 123 bpm.
Physical examination revealed a systolic murmur at the mitral focus with irradiation to the axilla and pulmonary rales.
Electrocardiography revealed no remarkable findings, except for sinus tachycardia.
Laboratory tests showed an elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and chest X-ray showed signs of pulmonary interstitial edema.
The patient was admitted to the Department of Cardiology with the diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure.
Transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with severely depressed ejection fraction due to generalized hypokinesia and a mild mitral regurgitation (fig.1a).
During admission, the patient had several episodes of paroxysmal dyspnea despite treatment with β-blockers and diuretics.
Due to the clinical suspicion of adrenal gland disease, 24-hour urinary catecholamine and metanephrine tests were requested.
Cardiac MRI was performed in order to complete the cardiomyopathy study, and confirmed the echocardiographic findings as well as revealed an incidental finding of a great left renal mass.
The 24-hour urine laboratory tests showed markedly elevated levels of norepinephrine, total catecholamines, normetanephrine and metanephrine with normal epinephrine values: 24-hour norepinephrine 468 μg (normal range: 23-105), 24-hour epinephrine 13 μg (normal range: 4-20), 24-hour total catecholamines 658 μg (normal range: 217-575), 24-hour normetanephrine 2,988 μg (normal range: 105-354), 24-hour total metanephrine 3,013 μg (normal range: 0-1,000).
Therefore, an abdominal MRI was performed, which showed the presence of two cystic masses (fig.2) located at the left hypochondrium.
Surgical resection of both masses was performed (after α-blockade with phenoxybenzamine and β-blockade with propranolol) through a laparoscopic approach, confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and clear cell renal carcinoma on histology.
During follow-up, blood pressure and heart rate values normalized (124/77 mm Hg, 78 bpm), 24-hour urinary catecholamine values returned to normal range (norepinephrine 69 μg/24 h, total catecholamine 221 μg/24 h, normetanephrine 202 μg/24 h and total metanephrine 259 μg/24 h) and the patient had no new episodes of palpitations or dyspnea.
Six months after surgical resection, echocardiography was repeated and showed a left ventricle with normal diameters and preserved ejection fraction (fig.1b).
Genetic analysis revealed a germline mutation (exon 3 deletion) of the VHL tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3.
As the patient had no family history of VHL, it was concluded that it was a de novo mutation.
"
"A 66 year old patient with a history of UC treated by mesalazine since 5 years consulted in July 2012 for a painful erythematous swelling of the back of the right hand.
The bacteriological samples were negative, the lesion was considered as an abscesses and the patient was treated with antibiotics and local antiseptics without improvement.
The evolution was characterized by the appearance of an erythematous vesiculobullous centrifugal expansion taking the whole back of the right hand treated several times by various antibiotics unsuccessfully.
Biopsy of this lesion was initially not specific.
In October 2012, the patient was hospitalized for fever and polyarthralgia in the context of impaired general condition.
He had a quiescent UC disease.
The skin examination found an erythematous plaque of 10 cm of diameter, with a raised border and vesicules, taking the back of the right hand and wrist (Figure 1).
There was also an infiltrated erythematous plaque on the right leg (Figure 2) and another topped with a large pustule at the left ankle (Figure 3).
In biology, there was a biological inflammatory syndrome and high leukocytosis with neutrophils.
Hepatic and renal functions were normal.
Skin biopsy showed at the edge of the back of the closet right hand ulcerated epidermis and the dermis infiltrate rich in neutrophils with leukocytoclastic vasculitis finding a PG (Figure 4).
Other biopsies taken at infiltrated erythematous plaques of the ankle showed a normal appearance of skin, edema of the superficial dermis based on an infiltrate rich in neutrophils without vasculitis confirming the diagnosis of SS (Figure 5).
Corticosteroid treatment was then started with prednisolone at a dose of 1mg/Kg/j.
The evolution was marked since day 7 of treatment by the desinfiltration of the plaques (Figure 6), the recovery of the general condition and disappearance of biological inflammatory syndrome.

"A female outpatient in her 50s had routinely visited our hospital because of liver cirrhosis resulting from hepatitis B virus and biliary duct stones.
At 65 years of age, she suffered from HCC with BCLC early stage A.
Her liver function was well preserved, and Child-Pugh score was A.
She underwent left lateral segmentectomy for HCC, without other preoperative treatments.
Histopathological findings revealed bridging fibrosis and pseudolobule formation.
Serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and protein induced by vitamin K absence-II normalized after primary resection (Figure 1).
In imaging studies, no LN metastasis was detected at the time of primary resection of HCC.
Two and a half years postoperatively, the patient’s AFP level increased dramatically to 780.2 ng/ml.
A lobular lesion with fine enhancement was detected by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
The tumor measured 27 mm in diameter and was located caudally on the left kidney.
In contrast-enhanced computed tomography, the tumor showed strong enhancement in the arterial phase (Figure 2A, 2B) and a relatively low density in the portal phase (Figure 2C, 2D).
These enhancement findings appeared consistent with a typical HCC pattern.
Detailed imaging studies of both magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography were performed in this case because a very rare metastatic LN initially seemed to be debatable and we needed to rule out exclusion diagnoses.
Three-dimensional imaging proved that the tumor was fed by a main vessel from the inferior mesenteric artery (red arrow) and by an accessory feeder from the superior mesenteric artery (Figure 3).
Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography did not detect the tumor (Figure 4), although we thought positron emission tomography-computed tomography was helpful to identify other metastatic tumors.
Further imaging findings revealed no other intrahepatic or extrahepatic metastasis.
Based on the tumor location, the clinical diagnosis was solitary metastasis to a mesocolic LN or HCC dissemination.
Determining the ideal therapeutic strategy for solitary but extrahepatic rare metastasis was difficult.
Although rapid growth was a critical concern in this case, the tumor was solitary and not accompanied by other metastases.
Considering both diagnostic and therapeutic viewpoints, we finally chose surgical resection in this case.
No disseminative nodules, lymphadenopathy, or ascites was observed during surgery.
The tumor was located in the mesocolon nearly at the wall of the descending colon, and partial resection of the descending colon with regional mesocolon was performed.
The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 8.
Serum levels of tumor marker decreased immediately after surgery (Figure 1).
Macroscopically, the mesocolic tumor was a solid and elastic mass with a smooth surface (Figure 5A).
A yellowish nodule was encapsulated in the cut surface (Figure 5B).
The enlarged LN contained metastatic HCC with a ductal structure (Figure 6A), and immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for AFP and negative for CK-20, which was consistent with the pattern of primary HCC (Figure 6B).
The histopathological diagnosis was metastatic HCC to a mesocolic LN.
As of the writing of this report, the patient has remained free of recurrence for 13 months after the second surgery, and has also been carefully followed up.
No adjuvant therapies have been performed.

"A 64 year old female known for HHT is referred to our clinic for recurrent epistaxis for nearly 50 years.
She has had recurrent symptoms since the age of 16 when her condition was diagnosed.
All three of her siblings also were diagnosed with HHT and her mother passed away from an intracranial hemorrhage.
Eight years prior to presentation she had undergone a left-sided septodermoplasty via a lateral rhinotomy approach.
This operation had significantly reduced the frequency of her symptoms and for several years her epistaxis was under control with the use of low dose thalidomide.
However, she was referred to our clinic due to increased epistaxis severity and frequency over the prior 12 months necessitating more frequent transfusions.
At the time of consultation the patient was concerned about daily severe left sided epistaxis despite several months use of topical bevacizumab and oral tranexamic acid.
She required intravenous iron and blood transfusions every two months.
Her baseline hemoglobin at the time of our consultation was 75 g/L (normal = 120 – 160 g/L).
Her HHT epistaxis severity score [17] was severe (normalized score 9.49).
On examination, she had multiple telangiectasia on her fingers, face, lips and palate.
Her endoscopic examination revealed bilateral telangiectasia along the nasal septum.
There was extensive crusting along the entire left nasal cavity with which any manipulation resulted in immediate profuse epistaxis.
Given the severity of the patient’s epistaxis despite medical therapy, she was offered endoscopic left-sided septodermoplasty.
The surgical goals were to improve her quality of life by reducing the number and severity of epistaxis episodes while diminishing the need for blood transfusions.
The patient was content with the treatment plan and agreed to undergo surgical intervention.
The endoscopic procedure was performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.
The nasal cavity was prepared by inserting pledgets soaked in topical adrenaline (1:1000) placed in both nostrils for decongestion.
Using a zero degree endoscope the residual STSG and mucosa of the left septum was dissected in a supraperichondrial plane that resulted in the expected significant diffuse hemorrhage.
Immediate hemostasis was attained using a topical gelatin-thrombin matrix, Floseal (FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix; Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) (Fig.1).
The mucosal defect (Fig.2) measured approximately 3 cm in anterior-posterior dimension.
A 4 x 2 cm split thickness skin graft was harvested from the right thigh, pie-crusted with a 15 blade and then placed endoscopically along the length of the septal defect.
As seen in Fig.3, the graft was placed with an overlap of the mucosa of the nasal floor and the residual superior septal mucosa.
Finally, 2 mL of fibrin sealant (TISSEEL fibrin sealant, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) was then applied first to the edges then central portion of the STSG (Fig.4).
Packing was not used post-operatively and the patient was discharged home on the same day of surgery.
Clinical follow-up two weeks after surgery (Fig.5) showed that the entire graft had taken and the left-sided epistaxis had dramatically diminished.
The patient was very content with the results of the procedure.
At 6 months follow-up, her baseline hemoglobin had improved to 102 g/L and she was requiring transfusions every 4 months with her hematologist’s intent to stop the transfusions if her hemoglobin remained greater than 100 g/L.
Her epistaxis severity score at 6 month follow up was mild (normalized score 3.05).

"A 33-year-old man presented with left flank dull ache.
On the abdominal computed tomography, a solid renal mass in the upper portion of the left kidney was identified.
The mass was measured 2.8 cm × 2.8 cm × 2.5 cm in size, was well-defined.
The patient had no other abnormal findings, such as suspected distant metastasis or lymph node metastasis.
Radical nephrectomy was performed on 14/9/2005.
On gross examination, the nephrectomy specimen measured 11.5 cm × 6.5 cm × 4.5 cm and the tumor was a solid, grayish-brown mass measured 3.5 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.2 cm in size.
Histologic examination demonstrated trabecular and ribbonlike patterns with minimal fibrotic stroma.
The cytoplasm was granular and eosinophilic with uniform round to oval nuclei with finely stippled chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.
Mitoses were not found (0 per 10 high-power fields) on H&E stain.
The final pathologic examination revealed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumor confined to the kidney (Fig.1).
Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated labeling with chromogranin, neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin (Fig.2), and the proliferation index was less than 2 % as measured by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67.
Further radiation and chemotherapy were not received.
Nine years after radical nephrectomy, computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a 2 cm × 1.8 cm cyst mass in the right liver and multiple high density shadow in gallbladder.
No enlarged lymph nodes were found in the abdominal cavity.
Cholecystectomy and extirpation for hepatic cyst were performed by laparoscopy surgery.
Histologic examination demonstrated trabecular and glandlike growth (Fig.3), moderate and uniform nuclei and mitoses weren't found (0 per 10 high-power fields).
Advanced immunohistochemistry revealed that the lesion was positive for synaptophysin (Fig.4) and CD56, but negative for chromogranin and neuron-specific enolase.
These features are supported in a neuroendocrine tumor.
Due to the similar pathologic characteristics between the primary renal carcinoid tumor and liver tumor.
The final pathology report indicated a carcinoid tumor of the left kidney with liver metastasis.
"
"A 50-year-old lady presented with complaints of pain abdomen and jaundice for one and a half months; she also complained of intermittent type of fever in the last 1 week.
Physical examination revealed presence of icterus and a palpable tender globular mass in the right hypochondrium measuring 3 × 3 cm.
A clinical diagnosis of obstructive jaundice secondary to periampullary carcinoma was made.
Ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and pelvis revealed dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary radicles (IHBR), with multiple freely mobile gall stones and a dilated common bile duct (CBD) measuring 1.8 cm with sudden narrowing at its distal end.
CT scan showed moderate dilatation of the extra and intrahepatic biliary radicles, cholelithiasis with suspicious thickening of the gall bladder wall at the fundus, and a distal CBD stricture.
There was no evidence of any distant metastasis (Fig.1).
A preoperative diagnosis of periampullary carcinoma with chronic cholecystitis was made, and the patient planned for a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple’s procedure) after optimization.
The patient underwent a classical Whipple’s procedure; table examination of the resected specimen revealed multiple gall stones in the gall bladder with area of mucosal thickening at the fundus and an irregular circumferential growth involving the intrapancreatic portion of the CBD.
Postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient recovered satisfactorily.
Histopathological examination of the resected specimen (Figs.2 and ​3) revealed thickening of the gall bladder wall at the fundus with multiple small calculi, the largest measuring 1.4 cm (Fig.3).
Sections studied from the area of thickening showed features suggestive of adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa.
Microscopic sections obtained from the distal CBD region showed adenocarcinoma of the common bile duct with invasion into the muscular wall of the duodenum.
Sections studied from the resected lymph nodes were free of tumor cells.
A pathological staging of pT1aN0M0 for adenocarcinoma of the gall bladder and pT2N0M0 for adenocarcinoma of the distal CBD was made, and the patient was not subjected to any adjuvant therapy.
The patient was disease-free 2 years after surgery.

"A 67-year-old woman was sent to emergency department because of fever and sore throat.
Her medical history included ESRD with regular hemodialysis 3 times per week for 15 years, hyperuricemia and gout.
She also had comorbidity such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and diabetes.
The hemogram revealed a white blood cell count (WBC) of 700/μL, with 2% neutrophils, 94% lymphocytes and 2% monocytes, hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count, 131,000/μL.
Under the impression of febrile neutropenia and acute pharyngitis, she was admitted to our hematologic ward for further survey and management.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics with piperacillin 2 g and tazobactam 0.25 gm i.v.
q8h had been administered and her infection sign resolved gradually.
Upon admission, we reviewed her oral medication: glipizide 5 mg tid, saxagliptin 2.5 mg qd, fenofibrate 600 mg qd, aluminum hydroxide 324 mg tid, folic acid 5 mg qd, calcium carbonate 1000 mg tid, and febuxostat 40 mg qd.
Besides, she also received epoetin-beta 2000 iu i.v.tiw.
Except for febuxostat, all the other drugs had been used for more than 1 year.
Febuxostat was administered 2½ months before admission for inadequate serum uric acid control by allopurinol 50 mg qd.
Two weeks before febuxostat exposure, routine laboratory test revealed WBC 6000/μL and serum uric acid level 9.8 mg/dL.
Febuxostat was discontinued thereafter due to the causal relationship of agranulocytosis cannot be excluded.
Besides, we also surveyed viral infection and autoimmune disorder.
There were no clinical or laboratory evidence of Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, or human immunodeficiency virus infections; antinuclear antibody (ANA) and antiextractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) were both negative.
Bone marrow examination during hospitalization showed hypocellular marrow with a marked decrease in myeloid component but no evidence of hematologic neoplasms.
Chromosome analysis of bone marrow was normal karyotype.
The patient denied history of radiation or chemicals exposure.
After stopping febuxostat for 17 days, her neutropenia improved significantly (WBC 2100/μL, and neutrophil 66%), without any granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support.
After discharge, her WBC and differential count was completely normal during follow-up (Fig.1).
This study was approved by our institutional review board.

"The patient was a 3-year-old girl with the following features of VACTERL association: absent C1 vertebra, supernumerary lumbar vertebrae, hypoplastic sacrum/coccyx, fatty filum terminale with tethered spinal cord, and three fused ribs; an anorectal malformation including a cloaca consisting of a common urogenital sinus and a duplex vagina with midline septum; type C TE fistula; right renal agenesis with moderate left hydronephrosis and vesicoureteral reflux.
She had no cardiac or limb malformations, and no other major organ anomalies.
Both she and her father were additionally clinically diagnosed with hypermobile type Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, but family history was otherwise noncontributory.
The diagnosis of hypermobile type Ehlers–Danlos was based on the patient’s hypermobility (9/9 on the Beighton hypermobility scale), very soft, fragile skin with unusual scarring, and poor skin healing.
Skin biopsy was not performed, but testing on peripheral blood did not reveal mutations associated with other forms of Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
Microarray analysis initially showed a maternally-inherited deletion at 4q35.1 detected with one clone and confirmed by FISH (RP11-173M11).
Subsequent performance of an 180K custom oligonucleotide microarray (Baylor College of Medicine Medical Genetics Laboratories) refined the deleted region deletion to a maximum size of 1.37 Mb, with karyotype revised to 46,XX,arr cgh 4q35.1q35.2 (187,321-768-188,694-589) 3 1.
Genes in the deleted region, which contains a number of much smaller copy number variations (CNVs) identified in normal controls, include CYP4V2, KLKB2, F11, MTRNR1A, and FAT1, none of which can be clearly related to her phenotype, especially as her mother, from whom the deletion was inherited, is unaffected.
Evidence for mitochondrial dysfunction began at 13 months of age with progressive muscle weakness, autonomic dysregulation, hypoglycemic episodes, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and decline of gastrointestinal function, eventually leading to total parenteral nutrition dependency due to visceral hyperalgesia, dysmotility, and malabsorption.
Muscle biopsy showed a mild increase in fiber size variability but no other findings consistent with mitochondrial disease, including via electron microscopy.
However, analysis of electron transport chain (ETC) activity showed normal activity of complexes I, II, and III, but complex IV, or cytochrome c oxidase, activity was 45.4 lmol/min/g weight, well below the control range (148.9 +/− 67.2 lmol/min/g weight).
Repeat ETC analysis in isolated mitochondria confirmed a profound and reproducible complex IV deficiency.
Citrate synthase activity and content in both ETC analyses were normal, confirming good sample quality and normal mitochondrial content.
Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing, and sequencing of DNA Polymerase Gamma 1 and 2 (POLG1 and POLG2) and Thymidine Phosphorylase did not reveal abnormalities.
"
"A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with a rash on his arms and neck (figure 1).
It had developed over the course of 36 h from discrete ‘pin prick’ areas of erythema into a maculopapular rash with vesicles (figure 2).
It covered his forearms from the dorsal aspect of the hands to the flexor surface of the elbows.
It was also beginning to develop around his neck (figure 3).
He described the rash as itchy and painful, and was feeling ‘under the weather’.
The patient had no previous dermatological or other medical history of note.
He took no medication.
He worked in a supermarket handling food items but there was no history of occupational chemical exposure.
He had not recently had any change in washing powder or personal hygiene products.
Physiological observations were entirely normal and systemic examination unremarkable.
Closer examination of the rash revealed that it was present only on skin exposed to the sun when wearing a short-sleeved shirt; the most striking feature was the ‘V’ shape on the patient's chest in keeping with the neck line of a polo shirt.
On further questioning the patient described a period of time 48 h prior to presentation (and 12 h prior to the development of the rash) spent strimming the grass under the hedges in his garden.
Blood tests including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function test and C-reactive protein were all within normal reference ranges.
The list of potential differential diagnoses for a maculopapular rash is long, but given the distribution of the rash and the history of plant material exposure a diagnosis of phytophotodermatitis was made.
The patient was discharged with chlorphenamine, simple analgesia and the advice to wear a long-sleeved t-shirt and sunscreen when gardening in the future.
The rash resolved over a period of 3 weeks.
It remained pruritic throughout healing but the associated pain settled over a few days.
Residual scarring is beginning to fade 2 months after presentation.

"A 7-year-old boy with Goldenhar syndrome with post-natal genetic diagnosis was referred to our Department of Radiology for imaging study of the temporal bone.
The patient underwent a 3D-CT scan.
Brilliance CT-64-channel (Philips Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was employed.
The protocol generated 120 kV and a current of 150 mA.
Slice thickness of the images was 1-mm with a 0.5-mm increment.
Images in DICOM format were processed on a PC using commercial software, obtaining a three-dimensional reconstruction of skeletal structures.
The 3-dimensional reconstruction of the skin plans showed hypoplasia of the auricle that on the right side consisted of a simple dysmorphic rough.
The left auricle had regular dimensions and morphology.
Atresia of the right auditory conduit and a normal left auditory conduit were observed.
The upper images showed partial ossification of the cranium typical in paediatric age.
Description of the profile: typical II class very convex profile with interposition of the inferior lip and a reduced neck-chin angle.(Fig.1).
Skeletal studies show that the mandibular condyle, ramus and corpus were shorter on the affected side.
Tilting of oral rhyme, occlusal plane and mandibular plane were evident.
Number or form abnormalities were not found during mixed dentition.
Mandibular condyles and temporo-mandibular joints seemed to be asymmetric, and in particular the right condyle was deformed, shorter and wider than the other side (mandibular condyle dimensions were 11 × 7 mm right and 14 × 7 mm left).
The 3-dimensional reconstruction of the skeleton planes showed the different morphology of the right and left hemimandibula.
Mandibular 3-dimensional reconstruction showed in detail the shift of the medial axis to the hypoplastic right side and the asymmetry of the right mandibular condyles that appears dysmorphic short and wide in axial and coronal scansions (Figs.2, 3).
The study of the temporal bone showed on the right side an external auditory canal atresia, hypoplasia of tympanic cavity that was not pneumatized and occupied by dense materials from soft parts.
No pneumatization was present in right mastoid cells.
Left external auditory canal dimensions and morphology were normal.
The left tympanic cavity was normally formed and totally occupied by dense materials from soft tissues.
Both right and left ears presented minor hypoplasia of auricle bones in the right side.
In agreement with the resolution of our instrument, normal representation of the malleus head that seemed articulated with a dysmorphic rough of a deformed incus was observed; it was impossible to see the staples.
The left malleus and incus were visible and appeared to be articulated in an abnormal manner (reduce contact surface); the staples was difficult to observe but seemed to have regular morphology.
Dimensions and morphology of cochlea semicircular canals, vestibulum and utriculum were unaltered (Figs.4-​7).
In conclusion, through 3D-CT valuation of this young patient we observed asymmetry of the condyles; in particular, the right condyle was dysmorphic, short and wide; the auricle of the right external ear was hypoplastic, only a dysmorphic rough was present; the right middle ear had a hypoplastic tympanic cavity; the right internal ear has an atresic auditory conduit.

"We present the case of a 66-year-old female patient with no significant past medical history presenting with chest pain that was treated with antacids by her primary care physician.
The next day she presented to the emergency room, where an electrocardiogram revealed posterolateral ST elevation myocardial infarction.
The patient was immediately taken to the catheterization lab.
A successful percutaneous intervention was performed on an acutely occluded large ramus intermedius vessel that was supplying a large portion of the lateral wall (Figure 1).
The patient did well initially, but several hours later she suddenly went into cardiogenic shock.
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed, and an echocardiogram demonstrated that she had severe mitral regurgitation from a ruptured papillary muscle (Figure 2).
The patient, on maximal support, deteriorated rapidly with progressive acidosis, oliguria, and florid pulmonary edema.
In spite of the very high risk, we decided to intervene surgically.
Once in the operating room, transesophageal echocardiography confirmed severe mitral regurgitation with a ruptured anterolateral papillary muscle and a small left atrium.
Shortly after the patient was put on cardiopulmonary bypass, the acidosis resolved and she began to make urine.
Excellent visualization of the mitral valve was obtained using a vertical transseptal approach through the right atrium.
The valve was carefully inspected and the necrotic ruptured anterolateral papillary muscle was seen (Figure 3).
There was a large chunk of muscle attached to the A1 chordal apparatus.
The anterior leaflet of the mitral valve was excised while keeping the posterior leaflet intact.
A 27-mm St Jude Epic bioprosthesis was inserted (Figure 4).
She was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation that was successfully weaned 3 days later.
Following this, she made a remarkable early recovery.
One month later, just prior to discharge, she expired after developing pneumonia that progressed to sepsis with multiorgan failure.
"
"A 46-year-old woman presented with severe acute pain in the right iliac fossa and periumbilical region.
Ultrasound and a computed tomography scan revealed a mucocele in the vermiform appendix, with a well defined lesion located at the mid zone of the appendix.
The patient underwent right hemicolectomy, and her postoperative clinical course was uneventful.
Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed an enlarged appendix, which was filled with thick mucinous material.
A distinct lesion which involved the appendiceal wall, and measured 1.5 cm maximally, was identified in the mid-portion of the appendix.
There was no evidence of perforation, extravasation of mucin into the periappendiceal tissue, or pseudomyxoma peritonei during surgery.
Histopathological examination showed combined GCC and MCA of the vermiform appendix (Figure ​1A).
The appendiceal lumen was dilated and lined by mucin-containing columnar epithelial cells (Figure 1B).
There was no significant cytologic atypia, and no mitotic figures were identified.
Focal papillary configurations of the lining epithelium, and mild epithelial pseudostratification were present.
In addition, the appendiceal wall was infiltrated by glandular structures of various sizes which were arranged in nests and tubules.
These glandular structures comprised 2 distinct types of cells: (1) small to intermediate sized monotonous neuroendocrine cells with a small amount of finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, and mild cytonuclear atypia (Figure ​(Figure1C);1C); (2) mucin-filled intermediate sized cells (goblet cells), with peripherally located small, crescent-like hyperchromatic nuclei, and indistinct nucleoli (Figure ​(Figure1D).1D).
Scattered infiltrating single goblet neoplastic cells were focally present.
As previously described[1] the tumor nests appeared to arise from the basiglandular region of the intestinal crypts in close proximity to the MCA (Figure ​(Figure1E).1E).
There was no lymphovascular invasion, although perineural and intraneural invasion was present.
The tumor infiltrated the full thickness of the appendiceal wall and extended to the mesoappendix.
Ten lymph nodes were histologically identified, of which all were negative for malignancy.
Immunohistochemically (Table ​1), the tumor cells of the GCC were positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and serotonin, which are neuroendocrine markers.
Diffuse staining for cytokeratin (CK) 20 (Figure ​2), CK19, and CD99 was also present.
The Ki67 proliferating index revealed nuclear staining in approximately 15% of the tumor cells.
There was no staining for CK7.

"In February 2010, a 77-year-old man with a history of stroke and peripheral vascular disease presented at our emergency department in florid pulmonary edema.
He had a 6-month history of worsening dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and leg edema.
Upon physical examination, he had diffuse rales and a murmur of aortic stenosis.
A 2-dimensional Doppler transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe aortic valve stenosis with a peak gradient of 70 mmHg and a mean gradient of 45 mmHg, a calculated aortic valve area of 0.7 cm2, severe mitral regurgitation, and a severely dilated left ventricle (LV) with an ejection fraction of 0.20.
After the pulmonary edema had resolved, cardiac catheterization confirmed the echocardiographic findings and showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease.
Given these findings and the patient's comorbidities, we decided on a minimally invasive surgical approach.
The patient was placed in the supine position and underwent anesthetic induction and intubation with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and a bronchial blocker.
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the previous findings, also showing that the mitral valve leaflets were free of significant disease and that the mitral regurgitation originated in the A2–P2 portion of the mitral valve (Fig.1).
The mitral regurgitation was thought to be functional, caused by mitral annular dilation and tethering of the papillary muscles by the severely dilated LV.
We decided to perform edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve from a transaortic approach.
A femoral platform was used to establish cardiopulmonary bypass.
A 2- to 3-cm incision was made in the left inguinal crease.
A 5–0 Prolene purse-string suture (Ethicon Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company; Somerville, NJ) was placed in the femoral artery and vein.
The left femoral artery was cannulated with a 16F–18F arterial cannula.
The left femoral vein was cannulated with a 25F Bio-Medicus® femoral venous cannula (Medtronic, Inc.; Minneapolis, Minn), which was placed in the superior vena cava with the aid of TEE.
We then made a 4- to 5-cm transverse parasternal incision over the 3rd intercostal space and transected the 4th costochondral cartilage to enable adequate exposure of the aorta.
This interspace was chosen in the event that the left atrium needed to be entered.
The pericardium was opened above the phrenic nerve and over the aorta to facilitate exposure.
A retrograde coronary sinus catheter was inserted directly through the incision, and a purse-string suture was placed in the right atrium.
A LV vent was inserted via a purse-string suture in the right superior pulmonary vein.
A transverse aortotomy was performed to expose the aortic valve, which was removed under direct vision.
The A2 and P2 segments of the mitral valve were identified, and an edge-to-edge repair was carried out with a 5–0 Prolene mattress suture that was reinforced with pericardial pledgets on the ventricular side of the mitral valve (Fig.2).
Next, a 27-mm Hancock® II bioprosthetic aortic valve (Medtronic) was implanted by use of standard techniques.
The aortotomy was closed in 2-layer fashion, and the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass.
The transected rib was reattached to the sternum with a 1-cm metal plate (Synthes, Inc.; West Chester, Pa), and a fiber wire was placed in figure-8 fashion.
A single chest tube was left in the pleural space.
The thoracotomy was closed in routine fashion.
Postoperative TEE showed no mitral regurgitation (Fig.3); “elbowing” of the anterior leaflet during mid-diastole due to tethering of the anterior leaflet to the posterior leaflet (Fig.4); and the double-orifice mitral valve that resulted from the edge-to-edge repair (Fig.5).
After surgery, the patient did well.
His shortness of breath resolved, and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6.
Upon follow-up evaluation in March 2011, he was asymptomatic, and echocardiography showed grade 1+ mitral regurgitation.

"A 58-year-old man had been suffering from general fatigue and severe anemia for several months.
His hemoglobin levels were 6.6 g/dl (normal range: 12–16 g/dl).
He had no medical history and did not take any medicine.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any significant bleeding.
Abdominal computer tomography revealed a 2-cm hypervascular tumor in the small intestine (Fig.1).
Oral DBE detected a 2-cm-diameter reddish, submucosal tumor-like lesion with surface ulceration in the jejunum, approximately 20 cm away from the Treitz ligament (Fig.2).
We did not perform biopsy because it can be difficult to stop bleeding in the case of hypervascular lesions.
Under the diagnosis of a small bowel tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), malignant lymphoma, or cancer, we performed laparoscopic-assisted segmental resection of the jejunum with the dissection of lymph nodes.
Examination of the resected tumor showed that it measured 19 × 16 mm in diameter (Fig.3).
Histology revealed the proliferation of blood capillaries and granulation tissue, which was consistent with PG (Fig.4).
The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9 without complication and his anemia improved gradually without the need for oral iron after surgery.
"
"A 68-year-old female nonsmoker, nondrinker with a medical history of hypertension presented with new-onset painless jaundice and pruritus, a three-month history of 9.9 kg weight loss and chronic diarrhea with four to five loose bowel movements per day.
Medications included vitamin D, amlodipine and eprosartan.
Physical examination was normal except for jaundice and muscle wasting.
Recent colonoscopy had been normal.
Total and direct bilirubin levels were 6.84 mg/dL (116.96 μmol/L) and 9.18 mg/dL (156.98 μmol/L), respectively.
Other results included an international normalized ratio of 1.0, alanine aminotransferase level 247 U/L (normal <33 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase level 139 U/L (normal <32 U/L) and alkaline phosphatase level 524 U/L (normal 35 to 104 U/L).
Viral hepatitis serologies, and antimitochondrial antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody tests were negative.
Her alpha-fetoprotein level was 2.4 ng/mL (normal <5 ng/mL), total immunoglobulin (Ig) G was 1880 mg/dL (normal <640 mg/dL), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was 856 U/mL (normal <33 U/mL) and IgG4 was 890 g/L (normal <3 g/L).
Doppler ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance imaging of the liver were suspicious for a subtly enhancing mass (2.8 cm to 4.2 cm in diameter) in the region of the hilum and porta hepatis, obstructing both the right and left hepatic ducts.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography identified strictures in the central portions of the right and left hepatic duct, which was concerning for cholangiocarcinoma (Figure 1).
Biliary brushings were negative for malignancy.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal.
Biopsies of the ampulla of Vater revealed chronic active duodenitis (Figures 2 and ​and3);3); an ancillary test confirmed the diagnosis (Figure 4).
Treatment with corticosteroids normalized the patient’s biochemical and radiological abnormalities within three months.
"
"The patient is a 59-year-old man diagnosed with PD at the age of 49 years.
Fluctuations with recurring “off” states and peak dose dyskinesias had severely diminished the patient’s quality of life.
Thus, the patient was deemed a candidate for bilateral subthalamic DBS.
Multidisciplinary evaluation with 75 % positive response in the standardized levodopa test, exclusion of cognitive decline or psychiatric comorbitity, and absence of structural brain damage potentially relevant to the lead placement led to the unanimous decision for DBS placement.
When decision was made to proceed to surgery the medication consisted of 1112.5 mg of levodopa and 150 mg of piribedil.
There was no history of orofacial or cervical dystonia.
In the “on” state the patient was alert without any signs of psychiatric comorbidity.
Neuropsychological testing was adequate.
No cranial nerve deficits were found and swallowing was normal.
Gait and postural stability was normal with minimal rigidity in the neck and right arm.
Coordinative motor skills such as rapid pro- and supination were restricted in the left hand.
Dyskinesias were evident with moderate impairment.
In the “off” state after the medication was held for 12 h, the patient showed mild dysarthria and dysphonia, resting tremor of the right arm and leg, as well as slight action tremor in the right hand.
Rigidity was severe in the neck, marked in the right, and mild on the left side.
Motor skills of the hands were markedly impaired.
Gait was slow but unaided and comprised of by intermittent freezing; there was mild dystonic posturing of the right foot.
There were no signs of laryngeal spasms, however.
On the day before surgery, the last dose of dopaminergic medication was administered at 07:00 p.m., the bedtime dose of levodopa was held to facilitate intraoperative testing.
On the day of the operation, the patient underwent placement of the stereotactic frame under local anaesthesia around 09:00 a.m.
After planning standard STN coordinates and trajectories, the patient was placed in a semi-sitting position on the O.R.
table, with the frame attached to the table.
At the patient’s request, the head was slightly flexed anteriorly for comfort.
The left electrode was placed uneventfully.
When performing the bur hole on the right side, the patient complained of cramping in the neck and facial muscles as well as difficulties breathing although at that point, pulse oximetry showed good saturation readings at ≥95 %.
He progressed to dystonic dysarthria [6].
Microelectrode recordings had already been done and macroelectrode test stimulation was about to begin, when the patient showed high-pitched inspiratory stridor.
Pulse oximetry showed decreasing oxygen saturation at 02:15 p.m.
and, shortly thereafter, narrow complex tachycardia was noted.
Within a minute, the patient became unresponsive.
Cardiac resuscitation was initiated and the patient was fiberoptically intubated after removal of the front bar of the stereotactic frame.
During fiberoptic intubation laryngeal spasm was confirmed visually.
A transthoracic echocardiogram obtained immediately after successful resuscitation showed no cardiac pathology or any air bubbles.
Stimulation using the implanted lead to resolve the symptoms was not possible as at that time the lead was subcutaneously tunnelled with no impulse generator attached.
The right permanent electrode was placed without further testing according to microelectrode recordings.
50 mg levodopa was administered over a nasogastric tube every two hours during the subsequent postoperative period.
Postoperative head CT scan done immediately after the procedure was normal.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was extubated at 02:00 p.m.
the following day without any neurological deficit or signs of laryngeal spasms.
By then, the nasogastric tube was discontinued and the preoperative medication was resumed.
Cardiac workup was negative.
The impulse generator was implanted 7 days later and the patient showed good symptom control of PD.
"
"A 73-year-old man who had been transferred to our emergency room due to sudden chest pain was diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
He had no coronary risk factors except for a history of smoking for 50 years.
Primary percutaneous coronary intervention was performed, and a long, string-shaped contrast defect was observed in the left anterior descending artery (Fig.1A).
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging revealed an odd, smooth-surfaced 50-mm long object (Fig.1B).
A long, white object which looked like a parasitic worm was retrieved via intracoronary aspiration and revascularization was successfully completed since neither plaque rupture or the presence of thrombus was detected by OCT (Fig.1C).
On the eleventh hospital day, transthoracic echocardiography revealed a new floating object in the left atrium.
Contrast computed tomography revealed a huge 7×6 cm mass that was recognized at admission in the right upper pulmonary lobe with direct pulmonary vein invasion (Fig.1D).
Although the bronchoscopic findings were negative for a lung tumor, a histopathologic examination of the aspirated coronary object revealed pleomorphic lung carcinoma (Fig.2).
The patient was diagnosed with STEMI due to coronary embolization associated with lung carcinoma.
Brain MRI revealed that the patient had an asymptomatic cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe and a small parietal lobe lesion was diagnosed to be metastasis.
Given all these observations, he was diagnosed with right lung carcinoma, stage IV (c-T2bN2M1b).
He was treated according to the chemotherapy regimens (carboplatin & paclitaxel) known to be effective for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
He responded to the treatment and showed a good clinical course afterwards (Fig.3).
Chemotherapy with a total of 9 cycles of the same regimen was used and the carcinoma progression was suppressed.
He has been doing well for more than two years of PCI and has been followed-up regularly.
"
"A 62-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of dyspnea on exertion, associated with both lower extremity edema.
Before this admission, he also had suffered from abdominal bloating and tasteless for a year with noticeable body weight loss at the same time (up to 20 kg).
Over the past 6 months, he developed a multiple system disorder, which included painless paresthesias in the lower limbs, erectile dysfunction, and chronic diarrhea.
He had an average stool frequency of up to ten times per day, with no obvious blood or mucus and no abdominal pain or tenesmus.
Unfortunately, previous stomach and rectum biopsy did not examine for accumulations of amyloid fibril protein.
His family history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, his blood pressure was 82/56 mmHg and heart rate was 52 bpm.
Significant jugular venous distention, moderate hepatomegaly, and lower extremity edema were noted.
A neurological examination revealed weakness and muscular atrophy in the bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius.
Hyporeflexia was noted on both knees and ankles.
Sensory examination revealed diminished tactile and pain sensation in a stocking and glove pattern and vibratory sensation was distally reduced in the lower limbs.
The motor and sensory functions of upper extremities were relatively spared.
Initial laboratory data that included full blood count, transaminase, creatinine, electrolytes, cardiac troponin, and thyroid function were normal or negative.
N-terminal fragment of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was 3,996 pg/mL.
Nerve conduction studies confirmed bilateral sensory-motor neuropathy (Table 1).
An electromyography study demonstrated active denervation and chronic reinnervation changes in the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm, low voltages in limb leads, QS waves in precordial and inferior leads, first-degree atrioventricular block, and prolonged QTc (Figure 1).
Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed marked concentrically thickened and speckled appearance of ventricular walls, biatrial dilatation, and left ventricular ejection fraction of 70% (Figure 2).
Doppler revealed a severe restrictive mitral filling pattern with E/A ratio 2.1.
Coronary angiography findings were normal.
The combined occurrence of low QRS voltage in the ECG, ventricular thickening, and signs of diastolic dysfunction is strongly suggestive of cardiac amyloidosis.
The following serum λ light-chain concentration was 1,763 (normal range: 598–1,329 mg/dL, and κ light-chain concentration was normal.
Rectum biopsy confirmed amyloid infiltrate (Figure 3).
So, the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis was established.
Despite chemotherapy administration of melphalan, dexamethasone, immunomodulator lenalidomide, and supportive therapy including montmorillonite to decrease diarrhea and low-dose furosemide to alleviate fluid retention, the patient continued to deteriorate and died at home after 3 months after the initial diagnosis.
"
"A 37-year-old Caucasian man was referred to our department from an external hospital because of severe abdominal pain of unclear aetiology.
The patient suffered from Friedreich's ataxia.1 2 His most recent transthoracic echocardiography, performed on the day of admission, showed a dilated cardiomyopathy, impaired left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 30% and a pulmonary artery pressure of 55 mm Hg; all findings were unchanged from previous examinations.
At that time, he lived alone in a residential home and was mobile using a wheelchair.
On arrival at our emergency department, the patient was somnolent and disoriented.
His axillary body temperature was 35.7 °C and his arterial blood pressure 125/89 mm Hg, with a pulse rate of 84 rhythmic beats/min.
He complained of an increasing, diffuse abdominal pain during the whole day, combined with absence of appetite and vomiting on a single occasion.
His daily medication was perindopril 2.5 mg, torasemide 7.5 mg and esomeprazole 40 mg.
On physical examination, we found a tender abdomen with painful epigastric palpation.
Normal bowel sounds were auscultated in the upper right and lower left quadrants.
The renal bed was free of pain on palpation.
On cardiac auscultation, a 2/6 systolic murmur was audible.
Lung auscultation showed normal respiration.
Laboratory findings were slightly elevated C reactive protein (CRP) of 16 mg/l (normal: <5 mg/l), elevated troponin-T-hs of 0.070 µg/l (normal: <0.014 µg/l) and highly elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide of 7382 pg/ml (normal: <63 pg/ml).
Kidney function parameters were in the upper normal range, with creatinine of 100 µmol/l and a calculated glomerular filtration rate of 73 ml/min.
Blood count revealed leucocytosis of 15.6×109/litre.
Regarding thyroid function, thyroid-stimulating hormone, f-T3 and f-T4 were in the reference range.
Urine analysis showed no pathology.
In abdominal sonography, all organs were normal, especially the kidneys.
No free fluid was detected (figure 1).
As the severe pain persisted all night, despite analgesia with paracetamol 1 g, metamizole 1 g and pethidine 75 µg, a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT was performed revealing infarction of the right kidney, which appeared as a hypodense area although kidney arteries and veins were assessed as open (figures 2 and ​3).
Cardiac dysfunction is the most frequent cause of death in patients affected by Friedreich's ataxia, most commonly from congestive heart failure or arrhythmia.
Renal artery embolism is not a rare event in these patients.
However, other non-abdominal viscous causes of severe diffuse abdominal pain such as porphyria, familial Mediterranean fever, diabetic ketoacidosis, tocopherol deficiency also had to be excluded.
The negative cardiolipin test excluded tabetic crises.
No evidence for pre-existing porphyria was encountered for example, quantitative determination of δ-aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen and porphyrin in 24-h urine was negative.
Further genetic diagnosis regarding, for example, clotting disorder, was also not conclusive.
Hypovitaminosis was not present.
The patient had no endocrinopathies, for example, no diabetes and no evidence for hypothyreosis or hyperthyreosis.
The patient was hospitalised without delay at the department of nephrology.
Immediate anticoagulation with heparin was initiated and later replaced by lifelong oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon.
During 11 days of hospitalisation, no complications occurred.
Kidney function parameters remained normal.
Transoesophageal echocardiography on the fifth day showed no cardiac thrombus and no patent foramen ovale.
Deep vein thrombosis was excluded with duplex sonography.
Anticardiolipin antibody testing and genetic testing regarding clotting disorders were both negative.
Urine tests revealed no evidence of porphyria.
During hospitalisation the patient remained stable regarding cardiological function, while diuretics were adjusted according to the fluid balance.
The patient had already been treated with levofloxacin for pneumonic infection prior to hospitalisation.
The antibiotic treatment was continued because of increasing inflammatory parameters in the further course of disease.
A CRP increase of up to 200 mg/l was interpreted as an inflammatory response to renal infarction.
By discharge, laboratory parameters were significantly decreased.
"
"A 36- year- old white woman at 40 week of gestation was admitted to a local obstetric clinic for elective repeated cesarean delivery due to slanting position of the fetus.
Both her previous and current pregnancy were uncomplicated.
Her past medical history was unremarkable and no family history of cardiac disease was reported.
The caesarean delivery was performed following the administration of standard spinal anesthesia.
During surgery the patient became hypotensive and ephedrine was injected to maintain her blood pressure in the normal range.
Three hours after delivery of healthy male infant, the patient complained of nausea, increasing dyspnoea and palpitations.
On physical examination tachycardia with ventricular extra systoles and pulmonary rales were detected.
Her blood pressure was 80/40 mmHg and demanded the administration of inotropic agents (initially continuous infusion of norepinephrine 0.5 mg/h followed by dobutamine 7 μg/kg/min).
Owing to worsening of oxygen saturation up to 70 % and gradual deterioration of consciousness, mechanical ventilation was applied and the patient was transferred to intensive care unit.
Chest X ray indicated pulmonary congestion.
Emergency computer tomography excluded pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) and confirmed severe pulmonary oedema (Fig.1).
The patient received loop diuretic, furosemide, at initial daily dose 80 mg, which was progressively reduced.
The diuretic was discontinued after 12 days of treatment.
The electrocardiogram disclosed sinus tachycardia with ST- segment elevation of 1,5 mm with negative T waves in aVL and ST- segment depression of 1 mm in II, III, aVF, V5-V6 (Fig.2).
Laboratory tests showed elevated troponin up to 908 pg/ml (normal value <14 pg/ml), NT- pro BNP 6236 pg/ml (normal value <125 pg/ml).
The bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction.
Therefore the patient was transferred to Intensive Cardiac Therapy Clinic.
Repeated TTE showed LV ejection fraction 30 % with hypokinesis of the mid and basal segments of posterior, anterior and lateral wall with preserved contractility of the apical segments.
Urgent coronary angiography presented normal coronary arteries.
The diagnosis of inverted stress- induced cardiomyopathy was set upon the overall clinical data.
After 3 days the patient was weaned from respirator and extubated.
Following hemodynamic improvement, inotropic agents were tapered gradually.
Both TTE and magnetic resonance imaging (Figs.3 and ​4) performed on the fifth day showed complete recovery of myocardial function.
The patient was discharged after 15 days in good overall condition.
At 12- month follow- up she remained asymptomatic with no echocardiographic abnormalities.

"This 73-year-old female, with a history of coronary artery disease and situs inversus, had recently noticed left arm exercise weakness.
The magnetic resonance angiogram and computer tomography of the upper limb vessels showed critical stenosis of the left-side SCA with calcification near the orifice (Fig.1).
Percutaneous revascularization was done via right femoral artery approach, and severe left SCA stenosis was confirmed (Fig.2A) (Supplementary Video 1, only online).
Direct stenting in the left SCA was carried out with a balloon-expansible Express LD 10×25 mm stent (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick, MA, USA) (Fig.2B) up to 8 atmospheres for 13 seconds.
However, severe shortness of breath and hypotension developed after stenting.
The blood pressure was down to 88/56, and the heart rate was up to 90.
The oxygen saturation was down to 74%.
Emergent intubation, fluid infusion, inotropic agent with norepinephrine were given.
The immediate angiography showed vascular perforation in the stented segment of left SCA (Fig.2C) (Supplementary Video 2, only online).
Emergency balloon inflation within the stent was done with an 8×40 mm balloon.
The cardiovascular surgeon was also consulted.
However, due to the high surgical risk of bypass, endovascular treatment was suggested.
We decided to do a retrograde approach through the left brachial artery by surgical cut-down.
Since there was no suitable graft stent in our cath lab, we modified and cut the iliac extension of self-expanding Endurant II graft stent 10×82 mm (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), which was originally designed to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), to a suitable length (around 30 mm) (Fig.3).
After retrograde wiring, an operator-modified Endurant II graft stent was deployed in the stent segment (Fig.2D) and the perforation was sealed successfully.
After stenting of the graft stent, however, slow flow of left common carotid artery (LCCA) was noted, and angiography confirmed the near total occlusion of the LCCA, occluded by the SCA graft stent (Fig.2E) (Supplementary Video 3, only online).
A firm wire (Conquest pro, Asahi Inc, Seto, Japan) was successfully advanced outside the graft stent and into the LCCA.
Despite sequent balloon dilations at the bifurcation site, the flow to the LCCA was still poor.
Intravascular ultrasound also confirmed the severe compromise of the LCCA ostium which was caused by the graft stent (Fig.2F).
Therefore, we put a balloon-expansible carotid stent, Express 7×37 mm (Boston Scientific Corporation), from the LCCA to the left brachiocephalic artery (Fig.4A).
TIMI III flow of the LCCA was restored after stenting (Fig.4B-E) (Supplementary Video 4, only online).
Intravascular ultrasound also confirmed proper expansion of the LCCA stent (Fig.4F).
The follow-up chest radiography revealed left-side hemothorax.
After thoracocentesis with drainage and proper care, the patient was discharged.
Till now, the patient has been free from symptoms for six months.

"A 50-year old man with a history of metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma presents for evaluation of a desquamating rash on his face that has spread to his scalp, inguinal region, and perineum over the past 4 months (Figure 1).
The rash has been accompanied by diffuse alopecia of the face, scalp, axilla, and groin.
There was no improvement in the rash despite multiple rounds of oral fluconazole, topical antibiotic ointment, and intravenous antibiotics.
Prior to the development of his rash, he completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection.
He underwent colostomy after he failed surgical correction for an enterocutaneous fistula, and he has required total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for the past year.
He did not notice any significant changes in ostomy output during this time.
Dermatological examination reveals widespread erythematous plaques on the face, scalp, and medial aspect of thighs bilaterally and scattered papules with scaling on face, scalp, chest, and back.
Diffuse, non-scarring alopecia is present on the face, scalp, axillae, and groin.
The patient had acquired AE, a rare dermatologic condition caused by zinc deficiency.
This patient developed acquired zinc deficiency in the setting of inadequate zinc supplementation in TPN.
The patient had not received trace elements for approximately one year due to a national shortage.
The key to the correct diagnosis of acquired AE is the combination of desquamating rash coupled with alopecia in the setting of chronic supplemental alimentation.
Although it is reasonable to consider a skin biopsy, a skin biopsy would not definitively establish the diagnosis.
A paraneoplastic panel could be considered, but it would delay diagnosis, and the presentation is most consistent with nutritional deficiency.
It is not appropriate to start a topical steroid cream until a diagnosis is determined.
The patient had a zinc level of 29 ug/dL (normal range 56-134 ug/dL).
He received zinc supplementation in his TPN, and within one month, the patient had complete resolution of rash and fatigue, and gradual return of hair growth (Figure 2).
Repeat zinc level following supplementation was 90 ug/dL.
Although the patient recovered from his zinc deficiency, he later passed away.
"
"A 65-year-old woman reported persistent back pain for almost 3 months.
The symptoms would be severe after walking or changing positions and would be slightly relieve after taking painkillers.
The patient described no pain or numbness in her legs.
She also described no bowel or bladder voiding difficulties.
The patient reported past medical history of hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and asthma, all of which were well controlled.
Physical exam demonstrated kyphosis of the thoracic spine in standing position and lumbar vertebra bend forward and backward straight activities were limited.
There is obvious rap pain in back about T12 level.
The patient's general medical examination was unremarkable in upper and lower extremity motor, stretch reflex, and sensory examinations.
X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams were performed after the patient in hospital (Fig.1).
The lateral X-ray showed T12 fracture with 40° kyphotic cobb angle.
CT showed an intravertebral vacuum sign.
Sagittal T1-weighted MRI showed a decreased signal intravertebral vacuum cleft and posterior cortex breakage with cord compression in T12.
Sagittal T2-weighted MRI showed an increased signal in the intravertebral vacuum cleft.
The patient was diagnosed with Kümmell disease (Stage III).[9]
The operation was performed under general anesthesia and prone position.
A standard posterior exposure of the spine was given, pedicle screws were inserted in target vertebrae T10, T11, L1, and L2 under C-arm guidance.[10] The screws were connected on the left side with a temporary stabilizing rod.
Laminectomy was performed to decompress and fully visualize the spinal cord.[10] Careful subperiosteal dissection was carried out on the right side to exposure the lateral wall of the T12 vertebral body until the anterior aspect was reached.
The right side pedicle and articular process of the T12 vertebral body were removed.
T11/T12 and T12/L1 intervertebral disks were also removed.
Then, the temporary stabilizing rod was replaced by rod bended to the desired contour.
Autologous bone graft and titanium mesh were placed in the intervertebral space.
Another rod with the desired contour was connected on the right side.
Adequate hemostasis was ensured and wound was thoroughly irrigated with saline.
Drainage tube was inserted and the surgical wound was closed layer-by-layer.[10] Time from skin incision to completion of wound closure lasted 150 minutes, and estimated blood loss totaled 600 mL.
Postoperatively, the patient was given preventive antibiotic treatment for 1 day, pain treatment for 3 days, and anticoagulant therapy for 1 week.
The drainage tube was removed at 3 days postoperative when volume of drainage was less than 50 mL per 24 hours.
Patient was allowed out of bed with a custom-made plastic orthosis at 1 week after operation.
The plastic orthosis was kept for at least 3 months.
The patient was allowed out of hospital at 12 days after operation when surgical suture had been removed.
Pain assessments were conducted using the visual analogue scale (VAS).
VAS for preoperative, 1 week after operation, and 1 year after operation were 9 score, 3 score, and 2 score, respectively, which demonstrated significant improvement.
The patient resumed normal activities and returned to work at 3 months after operation.
Kyphotic Cobb angle for preoperative, 1 week after operation, and 1 year after operation were 40°, 8°, and 17°, respectively, which demonstrated significant improvement (Fig.2).

"A 74-year-old man was referred to our hospital in November 2000 because of liver dysfunction detected during a medical checkup.
The patient had been diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome in 1995.
Laboratory examinations showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzymes and IgM, and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies.
Serologic markers for Hepatitis B and C viruses were negative.
Histopathologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen obtained at laparoscopy revealed non-suppurative destructive cholangitis in the portal area (Figure ​1).
The diagnosis of PBC (Scheuer stage 3) was confirmed and ursodeoxycholic acid, 900 mg daily, was started.
In January and June 2002, the patient underwent endoscopic variceal ligation plus endoscopic injection sclerotherapy as well as argon plasma coagulation for worsening esophageal varices.
In September 2007, the patient was admitted for the treatment of recurrent esophageal varices.
The platelet count had ranged between 52 × 109/L and 69 × 109/L for several years, but it was noted to decrease from 61 × 109/L in June 2007 to 8 × 109/L just before admission.
Before the deterioration of thrombocytopenia, the patient had no infectious diseases and received no other medication.
On admission, the patient had neither purpura nor bleeding episodes.
Table 1 shows the laboratory data on admission.
The platelet-associated IgG level was markedly high.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed normocellular marrow without cellular atypia.
Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cirrhotic liver with splenomegaly, ascites, and gallstones.
The spleen size had remained unchanged from previous imaging examinations.
Based on these findings, the association of PBC (decompensated liver cirrhosis) with ITP was diagnosed.
Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping determined by polymerase chain reaction-sequencing-based typing or polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers (SRL, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) detected A*02010101, B*400201, C*030401, C*07020101, DPB1*0501, DQA1*0103, DQA1*030101, DQB1*030201, DQB1*060101, DRB1*080201, and DRB1*080302.
The 13C urea breath test for H pylori infection was negative.
Figure ​2 shows the clinical course.
Oral prednisolone, 30 mg daily, for ITP was started on day 11, and diuretic therapy combined with albumin infusion for ascites was performed.
As the platelet count did not increase notably, pulse therapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, 1 g daily, was added on d 22 to 24.
However, the response was weak and temporary.
On d 31, mild melena was identified.
The patient was given a trial of intravenous immune gamma globulin therapy, 25 g daily, on d 32 to 36, combined with a second round of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy on d 32 to 34.
Because a moderate response was observed, prednisolone was continued, and the platelet count increased slowly.
The ascites was relatively well controlled with diuretics at discharge.
Considering the decompensated liver cirrhosis and the platelet count, we determined the patient required careful follow-up of esophageal varices without prophylactic endoscopic therapy.

"A 59-year-old man was referred to the general surgery department of our hospital for a one-month history of progressive dysphagia for solids, which was not associated with malnutrition or significant weight loss.
The patient had recently undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy in another hospital, which revealed a bleeding, ulcerative lesion in the middle third of the esophagus, but no biopsy had been collected.
The medical past history included COPD diagnosed in 1999 and a myocardial infarction in 2002.
The patient had smoked approximately 25 cigarettes per day for several years.
Physical examination was unremarkable.
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen revealed stenosis involving a 5-cm segment of the middle third of the esophagus with no other lesions in the thoracic or abdominal organs.
Barium studies disclosed a swelling in the esophageal wall 7 cm above the cardia with an ulcerative pattern, which reduced the diameter of the lumen to 5 mm.
An endoscopic biopsy of the oesophageal mass demonstrated poorly differentiated (G3) squamous cell carcinoma.
Mid-distal esophagectomy was performed with oesophagogastric anastomosis and gastric tube reconstruction.
Pathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the biopsy diagnosis of poorly differentiated (G3) SCC.
The tumor, which measured 3 cm of length, had infiltrated the oesophageal wall and the surrounding paraesophageal fat.
Surgical margins were tumor-free, as the seven perigastric limph-nodes dissected (pT3 N0).
The postoperative period was quite unremarkable, and a contrast enhanced x-ray obtained on the 9th POD showed normal esophageal and gastric transit.
On the 14th POD, the patient was discharged with an oncology referral for routine medical follow-up.
Nine months after the operation, CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy were repeated.
The imaging study revealed mild splenomegaly with multiple nonspecific nodules within the organ (Figure ​1).
The patient was virtually asymptomatic with the exception of a vague sensation of mild discomfort in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
FNAC of the spleen revealed a pattern of numerous inflammatory cells admixed with large cells displaying immunohistochemical positivity for several cytokeratins (Figure 2).
The specimen was Gram stain-negative.
A bone-marrow biopsy was negative for metastatic involvement.
The diagnosis was isolated metastases of the spleen with inflammatory and necrotic alterations.
The patient was referred to our centre for splenectomy, which was performed as a routine procedure to role out, also, a spontaneous rupture of the spleen.
On 12th December 2007, the patient had transabdominal total splenectomy with splenic and celiac artery lymph node dissection.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
On the 7th postoperative day, Doppler ultrasonography revealed portal-tree patency with no signs of thrombosis.
Ten days later, the patient was discharged with a stable platelet count (780,000/mm3), Hb 10.9 g/dL, and a WBC count of 16,500/mm3.
Pathological examination of the spleen described multiple nodules containing medium to large-sized cells, some of which were keratinized.
The nodules were mostly solid with areas of central necrosis (Figure ​3).
The findings were consistent with metastases of SCC.
Thereafter, the patient was referred to the oncology department of our hospital, where he received two 3-day cycles (separated by a 3-week interval) of systemic chemotherapy based on 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/day IV) and cisplatin (20 mg/day).
Three months after the splenectomy, multiple liver metastases were seen on the CT scan, and cutaneous metastases were also present.
The patient died 9 months later.
"
"A 47-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a 1-month history of abdominal distention.
Physical examination revealed a huge mass in the lower abdomen.
The peripheral blood test showed elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, 335.2 ng/mL [normal, <5 ng/mL]) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 (219 U/mL [normal, <45 U/mL]) but a normal level of CA19-9 (9 U/mL [normal, <37 U/mL]).
Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a large, round mass with a maximum diameter of 15 cm in the pelvic cavity without the presence of ascites or pleural effusion (Fig.1a, ​b).
Colonoscopy identified an elevated lesion with severe stenosis in the sigmoid colon, and histopathological examination of biopsy specimens from the tumor showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Although we scheduled an early operation, the patient developed acute dyspnea and general edema 2 weeks after the first CT scan.
The second CT scan examination demonstrated massive bilateral pleural effusion with atelectasis and ascites (Fig.2a, b).
Thoracic drainage and laparotomy were emergently performed.
Macroscopically, the tumor in the sigmoid colon had invaded the serosa, and the huge pelvic mass was found to contain a right ovarian tumor.
Several small nodules of peritoneal dissemination were distributed over the greater omentum.
Perioperatively, 3800 mL of serous ascitic fluid was drained.
Cytodiagnosis of the fluid drained from the ascites and pleural effusion revealed no tumor cells.
Bilateral oophorectomy, total hysterectomy, omentectomy, and sigmoidectomy with regional node dissection were performed (Fig.3a).
Histopathological examination of the resected specimens showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the tumors of both the ovaries and the sigmoid colon (Fig.3b).
The dissected paracolic nodes showed malignant cells.
Immunohistochemically, tumor cells from the ovaries and the colon both showed positive expression of cytokeratin 20 (CK20) but no expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7), confirming that the ovarian tumors were metastases from primary colon cancer (Fig.4a, ​b).
The postoperative course was uneventful, and both pleural effusion and ascites rapidly resolved.
Postoperatively, a regimen of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) was administered every 2 weeks for 5 months.
At 29 months after the first operation, the patient required curative hepatic resection for liver metastases.
At 78 months after the first operation, the patient remains alive with no evidence of a disease.

"A 35-year-old woman was admitted with a 5-day history of increasing drowsiness, fatigue, personality changes, generalised weakness and deteriorating mobility.
Her medical history included a 10-year history of schizo-affective disorder, lithium-induced diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism.
Her medications included sodium valproate 1 g twice daily, carbamazepine, quetiapine and lithium.
On admission, the patient was drowsy, difficult to rouse (sleeping all night and in the afternoon).
Her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 14/15, her abbreviated mini-mental test score was 6/10 and she was noted to be slow in her responses.
Neurological examination showed reduced power in her lower limbs (3–4/5) in a pyramidal distribution, and brisk reflexes with intact sensation in all modalities.
Cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal examinations were unremarkable and there were no demonstrable features of hepatic disease.
Routine biochemistry was unremarkable.
The patient's alanine transaminase was 7 u/L (1–15), alkaline phosphatase 61 u/L (30–130), γ-glutamyl transferase 17 u/L (<45) and bilirubin was 6 μmol/L (<21).
She had normal serum B12 and folate levels, and normal thyroid function tests.
Serum lithium levels were within the therapeutic range.
Her serum ammonia was 47 μmol/L (11.2–35.4) and valproate concentrations were elevated 140 mg/L (50–100).
Brain imaging including CT and MRI did not show any haemorrhage or intracranial mass.
Lumbar puncture demonstrated clear cerebrospinal fluid (white cell count <1×106/L, protein 0.25 g/L (0.2–0.4)).
EEG demonstrated mild variable slowing and irregularity of background activity (likely due to medication).
The differential diagnosis included encephalitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which were excluded through our investigations.
In view of the raised valproate and ammonia levels, a diagnosis of valproate hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (VHE) was made at this point
The dose of sodium valproate was reduced by half rather than being completely withdrawn.
This was due to the complex and challenging nature of managing the patient's schizo-affective disorder.
Within 3 days, there was evident clinical improvement in her mental status.
The patient was able to sit and communicate with the team, and her abbreviated mental test score improved to 10/10.The serum ammonia normalised and valproate levels decreased to the therapeutic range.
After 4 days she was discharged home.
Results of investigations of her urea cycle were awaited.
Three weeks postdischarge, the patient was clinically stable in terms of mental functioning, having had no further episodes of confusion or drowsiness.
However, she continued to have fatigue and walking difficulties (due to residual leg weakness).
Results of her serum amino acids revealed that our patient had carnitine deficiency evident by low acyl-carnitine, low free serum carnitine (14.2 μmol/L, normal range: 23–52) and low total serum carnitine (19.9 μmol/L, normal range: 27–63).
She was started on oral carnitine 1 g twice daily.
Within 2 weeks, her symptoms resolved completely with normalisation of serum carnitine levels (free carnitine 25.2 μmol/L and total carnitine of 41.3 μmol/L).
The sodium valproate was initially stopped completely, but due to a serious relapse of the patient's schizo-affective disorder, it was restarted and she is now well on valproate 1 g once daily and long-term carnitine supplements.

"A 46-year-old Caucasian woman of Ashkenazi Jewish descent presented with the chief complaint of severe and constant throbbing pain in her left posterior mandible.
She reported that her pain was aggravated by chewing, and started months before the initial consultation visit.
Visual analog scale of pain was reported 7/10 at the day of the visit.
Past medical history was remarkable for Gaucher disease, left hip replacement, gall bladder removal, herniorrhaphy, spleen abscess drainage, hepatitis C infection, and asthma.
Social history was significant for 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking.
Her family history was unremarkable for any hereditary or systemic diseases.
Her medications included the oral antiresorptive drug alendronate for early osteoporosis associated with Gaucher disease (70mg weekly for 2 years), calcium supplements, loratadine, hydromorphone, esomeprazole, promethazine, levalbuterol, carisoprodol, fluticasone and ibuprofen.
She reported that she had been on enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) intermittently for several years to treat her Gaucher disease which was diagnosed 20 years prior.
She received intravenous injections twice a month for ERT and recounted fatigue after each infusion.
She also reported receiving antibiotic and analgesic medications for her pain months ago but they were not helpful.Head and neck examination, cranial nerve examination and vital signs were within normal limits.
Intraoral examination was completed using percussion testing, vitality testing and probing for evaluation of her mandibular posterior teeth in the region of the chief complaint.
Her left mandibular first molar was endodontically treated 3 years prior and tested non-vital, while her remaining mandibular teeth were normal on vitality testing with evaluation of several opposing non-restored and non-carious teeth as internal controls.
Gingival tissues in both jaws were non-inflamed and there was no gross evidence of plaque or calculus.
Periodontal pockets in her mandible ranged from 4 to 6mm with no significant bony defects.
Full mouth dental X-rays and a panoramic radiograph were taken and showed relatively well-defined radiolucent lesions in multiple regions of the mandible bilaterally, with a pseudocystic (multilocular) appearance; cone-beam computed tomography confirmed these findings and revealed a large lytic lesion of her left posterior mandible in the region of her chief complaint (Figure 1).Our clinical and radiographic differential diagnosis for her chief complaint included chronic apical periodontitis, radicular cyst, central giant cell granuloma, keratocystic odontogenic tumor, ameloblastoma, odontogenic fibroma, neuralgia/neuropathy or mandibular involvement of Gaucher disease given her medical history.
Our findings were discussed with the patient and written consent was obtained for surgical biopsy of her left mandible with local anesthesia for more definitive diagnosis.
A four-corner gingival flap buccally was reflected in her posterior left mandible extending from the canine to the second molar, and cortical bone was removed with a surgical bur to create a window for access to the lesion.
Pathologic soft tissue was evident through the access window.
The entire pathologic soft tissue along with the bone from the access window was submitted to the pathology laboratory for histological evaluation.
Histopathological findings revealed infiltration of jawbone marrow with fibrous connective tissue containing abundant Gaucher cells (Figure 2).
There was no evidence of abscess or neutrophils, granuloma or malignancy.
Postoperative healing was uneventful, and the patient reported resolution of her chief complaint and symptomatology at 1-month follow-up.
She was referred to her physician for consultation and further evaluation as related to her Gaucher disease status following our findings.
She was again treated with ERT and at 1-year re-evaluation was still symptom free in her oral cavity.

"A 19-year-old man presented at the emergency department, 12 h after insertion of a high pressure container with tanning spray into his rectum.
A plain abdominal radiograph (Figure 1) showed the container in the rectosigmoid region.
There were no signs of perforation.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed under conscious sedation.
The object was located just above the rectosigmoid junction.
The container could not be extracted by bimanual manipulation.
An attempt to remove the object with conventional endoscopic instruments, such as polypectomy snares, was unsuccessful.
The sigmoidoscope could be passed alongside the foreign body to its proximal end.
A guide wire was left behind with the sigmoidoscope removed.
Subsequently, a 40 mm pneumatic dilatation balloon (Rigiflex®, Boston Scientific), normally used in achalasia patients, was inserted over the guide wire and inflated just above the container (Figure 2).
For safety purposes, the sigmoidoscope was reintroduced alongside the catheter of the balloon to allow endoscopic visual control of the distal end of the container in the rectum.
Gentle traction was exerted on the balloon catheter, and the container was successfully removed under fluoroscopic and endoscopic control (Figure ​3).

"An 81-year-old female with hypertension and gout was admitted to Taichung Veterans General Hospital due to abdominal pain and hematemesis.
She began to suffer from intermittent epigastralgia more than 10 years ago, and a 4 cm gastric tumor was found.
The abdominal pain got worse 2 years before admission, and she went to a local hospital where abdominal CT scan revealed a gastric tumor about 6 cm in length with well-circumscribed calcification(figure ​1).
Surgical intervention was suggested, but she declined.
About 10 days before admission, tarry stool passage was noted, and bloody vomitus was found 1 day later.
UGI scope revealed submucosal gastric tumor with central ulceration and she was then transferred to our hospital.
Physical examination showed upper abdominal tenderness with mild muscle guarding.
The plain radiography showed an irregular shape calcification over upper abdomen.
UGI scope revealed deep gastric ulcer with foreign body.
CT scan showed an irregularly shaped space-occupying lesion in front of the stomach with plate calcifications and localized free air (figures 2 and 3).
Under the impression of perforated gastric tumor, emergent laparotomy was performed.
An infiltrative mass between the stomach and transverse colon was noted during operation.
A sharp, bone-like and thick calcified plate penetrating into the gastric mucosa and pericolic soft tissue was observed.
A submucosal tumor about 2.3 cm in size adherent to the calcified plate was also noted (figures ​4 and 5).
Distal subtotal gastrectomy and partial colectomy were performed.
The patient was discharged 13 days after operation uneventfully.
Microscopically, spindle-shaped tumor cells with low mitotic frequency (4/50 HPF) were found.
Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor demonstrated diffusely strong positive reactivity for CD 117, positive reactivity for CD34, but negative reactivity for S100 protein and desmin.
The diagnosis of the tumor was established as GIST.
Due to the small size and the paucity of mitotic figures of the tumor located in the stomach, it was classified as very low risk[4].
Sporadic GIST was impressed due to no family history of GIST nor other GIST presented in this patient.

"Our 24-year-old non-smoking male patient presented with repeated hemoptysis in May 2008 with 4 days of concomitant right thoracic pain which intensified while breathing.
During holidays in his home country, this Cuban patient suffered from a cold with fever and a strong cough.
The strong dry cough persisted after recovery from the cold.
The patient did not report any loss of weight.
The initial CT scan of the thorax showed a 12 × 4 cm solid mass paravertebral right in the lower thorax without any signs of metastases (Figure 1).
The bronchoscopy (Figure ​2) with non-bleeding biopsy revealed a mass of the lower right bronchus which histologically and immunohistologically provided evidence of a granular cell or Abrikossoff tumor [1].
The bronchial lavage which followed was negative for malignant cells.
The patient was discharged and surgical intervention was planned.
Four days after discharge a spontaneous hemothorax developed.
The patient needed to be readmitted and the hemothorax was drained.
No malignant cells were detected in the cytological examination of the drained liquid.
After an uneventful course and decreasing of the hematoma, the tumor was excised by performing a lower right lobectomy 6 months after the initial admission.
The final histological examination confirmed a peribronchial and infiltrating S100 positive tumor supporting the Schwann cell origin theory with very low growth rate of 2% and a size of 15 mm (Figure ​3).
"
"A 27 years old, male, right handed, was admitted for a 2 years history of very frequent gelastic seizures.
The patient described aura–like symptoms: especially warmth throughout the face and dizziness that preceded the seizure and he denied any affective connotation.
Some of the seizures consisted only of a brief period of laughter without any motor involvement, but a typical seizure would consist of sudden laughter accompanied by simple motor partial seizures in both arms, more often being involved his left arm, without impairment of his consciousness state, which lasted less than 1 minute.
He had no previous past medical or social history other than being a smoker: 10–15 cigarettes per day.
The frequency of the seizures was initially low, but increased progressively over time to about 8–10 seizures/day, despite anti–epileptic treatment – at the time of admission he was taking Keppra – Levetiracetam 3 x 250 mg/day and Phenytoin 3 x 100 mg/day.
With the Neurology Electrophysiology Department assistance we have been able to record a couple of seizures on the Video–EEG His neurological examination was normal.
Diagnosis was made on native CT scan: minimal hypodense frontal right paramedian lesion (Figure 1A), cerebral MRI (Figure 1 B–F) showed a small right parenchymal homogeneous lesion 16/22/15mm, well delimited, involving gyrus cinguli, without perilesional edema and mass effect, hyperintense both on T1 and T2 MR sequences, non–enhancing after Gadolinium.
The cerebral lesion was also documented on EEG and video–EEG recordings: 3 seizures with medio–frontal origin and rare interictal epileptiform elements were recorded (Figure 1I)
Using an interhemispheric microsurgical approach, above the corpus callosum and the right pericallosal artery, at the level of gyrus cinguli, a yellow–gray, infiltrative tumour, having a moderate vascularisation had been identified and totally removed.
The anatomo–pathological analysis revealed a grade Ⅱ astrocytoma.
The patient recovered very well, without deficits, no gelastic seizures or epileptic manifestations; three months after operation he is still free of seizures.
A control postop CT revealed no tumor (1 G, H)
"
"A 36-yr-old previously healthy Sri Lankan male who takes care of a horse presented to the medical casualty ward with fever, arthralgia and myalgia for one day.
He complained of mild dysuria but had normal urine output.
He did not have chest pain or shortness of breath.
Further inquiry revealed that he was treated for leptospirosis during a febrile illness in the past.
On examination, patient was afebrile, anicteric.
His blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and pulse rate 76 bpm.
Rest of the examination was unremarkable.
Initial investigations performed on the day of admission revealed neutrophil leukocytosis, mild thrombocytopaenia and microscopic haematuria (Table 1).
Renal function and liver enzymes were within normal limits.
Urine analysis revealed pus cells 05 – 06 /hpf, red cells 30 – 35 /hpf.
CRP (C-reactive protein) was 75 mg/dl.
A clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis was made and he was started on intravenous penicillin in addition to adequate hydration.
On the second day of illness, he developed hypotension with tachycardia and dyspnoea.
ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with ST depression in leads V4 – V6 [Figure 1].
His CXR (chest x ray) showed gross cardiomegaly and bilateral pulmonary shadows [Figure 2].
CVP (central venous pressure) was 16 cmH2O and 2D echocardiogram revealed dilatation of all four chambers, severe global hypokinesia and ejection fraction of 20%.
Troponin I was 12.77 ng/ml (normal range < 0.40).
He was diagnosed to have early and severe myocarditis.
Patient was transferred to ICU (intensive care unit) as he needed inotropic support.
Intravenous antibiotics including penicillin, meropenem and levofloxacin were continued.
Patient was electively ventilated on the 3rd day of illness due to severe respiratory distress.
On the same day, he developed rapid atrial fibrillation [Figure 3] unresponsive to digoxin and intravenous amiodarone.
Platelet count dropped to 10 × 103 μ/L and he was given platelet transfusions to prevent bleeding [Table 1].
We started intravenous methylprednisolone based on previous studies showing a mortality benefit in severe leptospirosis complicated with myocarditis [11].
His serum creatinine increased to 362 μ mol/L by the 5th day of illness and ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase) were markedly elevated up to 2726 U/l and 7438 U/l respectively.
Dengue and Mycoplasma infections were excluded.
Blood cultures were negative.
Leptospira IgM antibody performed on the 5th day of illness was positive (IgG negative).
Patient developed refractory shock and died of persistent ventricular tachycardia despite optimal treatment in the ICU.
"
"A 19-year-old woman presented with a lump in her right breast.
She had macrocephaly and milimetric papules on the tongue giving a cobble stone appearance.
The breast ultrasonography (US) showed more than twenty circumscribed, oval masses in each breast.
An US-guided core biopsy was performed for the palpable masses which were confirmed as juvenile fibroadenomas.
After the biopsy, a breast US was done as follow-up every 6 or 12 months for 3 years.
During the surveillance period, core biopsies were performed six times, followed by US-guided vacuum-assisted core needle excisions or surgical excisions of lesions with increased sizes.
Pathologic results were fibroadenoma, tubular adenoma or atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) involving fibroadenoma.
At the age of 19 years, the patient underwent a neck US for a palpable mass in the left neck.
Several indeterminate nodules were revealed in both thyroid glands.
A follow-up US revealed that some of those nodules increased in size.
The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and the pathologic result revealed an invasive follicular carcinoma in the left thyroid and follicular adenoma in the right thyroid (Fig.1A).
At the age of 21 years, she visited the hospital due to a swelling of her left cheek.
Head and neck CT scan revealed a vascular mass in the left parotid gland extended into the left forehead.
An external carotid angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an AVM with feeder vessel arising from the left internal maxillary artery (Fig.1B).
A partial embolization decreased the blood flow through the AVM, alleviating the patient's symptom.
She was referred to genetic counseling under the suggestion of a Cowden syndrome and the PTEN DNA sequencing test of her blood sample revealed a frameshift mutation, c.301dupA (p.I101NfsX6).
At the age of 22 years, the patient presented with a mass with increased size and increased vascularity in the left breast.
An US-guided vacuum-assisted core needle excision revealed a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of non-comedo type and a low grade involving fibroadenoma (Fig.1C).
The contrast-enhanced breast MRI for the preoperative evaluation demonstrated multiple, well-circumscribed, enhancing masses in both breasts (Fig.1D).
All masses showed high or intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images (Fig.1E).
Several masses showed an early rapid enhancement with washout kinetic pattern on time-signal intensity curve evaluation, which tends to be associated with malignancy (Fig.1F).
A bilateral prophylactic mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction was performed in view of multiple bilateral breast masses with suspicious kinetic features on breast MRI and a high risk for breast cancer of Cowden syndrome.
The surgical histopathology revealed ADH involving tubular adenoma without residual carcinoma in the left breast and multiple tubular adenomas, fibroadenomas and intraductal papillomas in both breasts.
The patient had no family history of breast cancer or Cowden syndrome.
"
"A 49-year-old man, with no history of cardiac disease, presented with progressive dyspnea of one month's duration.
Medical History.
His medical history included blunt chest trauma, the result of an accidental fall from scaffolding 15 months earlier.
He had fallen approximately 8 feet and had landed on the right side of his back and on his right shoulder.
The patient had sustained bilateral pneumothorax, right iliopsoas muscle hematoma, multiple right costal fractures, fracture of the L3 vertebral body and the transverse process, and displaced fractures of the right clavicle.
That hospitalization had lasted 40 days, during which time the clinicians had not detected any murmur or requested a cardiac evaluation.
The patient returned to normal activities 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital and remained asymptomatic for one year.
Upon his arrival at our department, auscultation revealed bibasilar rales and a pansystolic murmur.
Chest radiography showed mild lung congestion; and transthoracic echocardiography, limited by suboptimal acoustic windows, revealed severe, eccentric mitral regurgitation.
The valvular and subvalvular apparatus appeared to be structurally normal, and the left atrium was only mildly dilated.
The patient was treated with intravenous diuretics until the signs and symptoms of congestion were relieved.
Coronary angiography revealed an absence of substantial coronary disease.
We therefore planned an elective surgical procedure for mitral valve repair.
Surgical Procedure.
During intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), we observed both a trivial central mitral regurgitant jet and a severe perivalvular regurgitant jet, this last originating from a ventriculoatrial fistulous communication behind the P1 scallop (Fig.1).
Further examination confirmed the absence of structural disease involving the mitral leaflets or subvalvular apparatus.
After surgical exposure of the mitral valve, a small tear (length, 6–7 mm) could be seen behind the posterior leaflet, in a lateral position, involving also the annulus and the left atrial wall.
The absence of leaflet abnormalities or vegetations suggested the posttraumatic origin of the perivalvular leak.
Valvular repair was successfully achieved by direct suture of the tear with three 5-0 Prolene stitches and by the subsequent insertion of a 30-mm mitral annuloplasty ring.
The patient was extubated the next day and his postsurgical course was uncomplicated.
One year later, he was asymptomatic, and his one-year follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram confirmed the excellent result of his surgical treatment.
"
"The 21-year-old patient presented to the closest emergency department at 8 PM for nausea, numbness of the left limbs, incoordination of walking and dysarthria, with the symptomatology installed in a progressive mode 4 hours before presentation.
The nausea was the initial symptom, starting at 4 PM (without headache, nuchal pain, or vomit) and then, after 5.30 PM, the numbness of the left limbs and the incoordination of walking and by 7 PM dysarthria was added to the entire clinical constellation.
The patient did not have a medical history or a current medication.
He was a student.
He did not smoke and did not use recreational drugs.
He only drank alcohol occasionally.
There was no family history of thromboembolism, cardiovascular problems, or hematologic diseases.
He was first evaluated by a neurosurgeon in the emergency unit and had a brain CT scan that highlighted infracentimetric hypodensity in the thalamic nucleus, on the left side and at the level of the right cerebellar hemisphere in the PICA territory, and also a chest X-ray that revealed a widened projection area of the right side hilum, without any other pathological findings.
Following this evaluation, he was sent to the National Institute of Neurology and Cerebrovascular Diseases for consultation and special treatment.
During the ambulance transportation, he had repeated episodes of vomiting.
The initial physical examination (at 10 P.M) showed normal vital signs: blood pressure 130/ 80mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per minute and normal body temperature 36,8°C.
The cardiopulmonary exam was normal.
No carotid bruits were registered.
The neurological examination was notable for normal orientation.
The patient had equal, reactive pupils, divergent strabismus to the left eye, horizontal nystagmus, normal deglutition, mild paresis of the left arm, ataxia of all limbs, with an accent on the left extremities, numbness of the left limbs, bilateral response present at all deep tendons reflex, Babinski sign on the left side, stereotypical language.
The patient was able to repeat a few words and fragment of phrases and to perform simple commands of medium complexity.
The laboratory analysis highlighted a normal hemoleucogram, normal blood glucose level 9,11 mmol/ L (normal range 3,9-5,8mmol/ L), serum creatinine 0,69mmol/ L (range 0,5-0,9mmol/ L), total serum cholesterol 5,2mmol/ L (normal range < 5,2 mmol/ L).
The tests for thrombophilia were negative.
He also presented a normal sinus rhythm on the ECG.
The brain CT performed at the first emergency unit, as mentioned above, revealed a infracentimetric hypodensity at the level of the left thalamic nucleus and at the level of the right cerebellar hemisphere in the PICA territory.
Doppler ultrasound for cerebral and cervical blood vessels highlighted the marked frena in the flow velocities of the V2 segment of the right vertebral artery, an accentuated aspect in the high V2 segments with the complete disappearance of the flow in the V3 segment, without carotid atheromatous lesions or modifications of the trajectories or the arterial caliber.
Overall, there was a possibility of a dissection of the right vertebral artery in the higher segments with indication of cerebral and angio MRI.
Cerebral and angio MRI showed: areas with T2, FLAIR hypersignal, with an important restriction of diffusion and low ADC, situated in the right cerebellar area of the postero-inferior territory, anterior bilateral cerebellar territory, left cerebellar peduncle, both right > left thalamic nuclei, as well as subcortical occipital bilateral, with an ischemic aspect that was recently constituted in the vertebrobasilar territory.
T1 FS hypersignal was present on the entire intracranial segment of the right vertebral artery and the cranio-spinal junction.
On the angiographic arterial 3D TOF sequence, the presence of the rapid flow of the right vertebral artery could be viewed, up to the C2 segment, where there was a progressive pinch out with an aspect of flute beak shape.
Distal of this level, there was an absence of the rapid flow signal and also a lack of right PICA visualization.
The MRI aspect suggested a subacute dissection of the right vertebral artery.
The cerebral ventricular system had normal dimensions, shape, and topography.
The pericerebral fluid spaces and the basal cisterns were normal.
Conclusions: there were some ischemic lesions recently constituted in the vertebrobasilar territory and also a subacute dissection of the right vertebral artery.
Heparin administration was started immediately in the process of hospitalization because of the dissection.
The APTT value was kept in the range of 50-70 seconds.
Also, the prophylactic therapy for stress ulcer was performed.
After 7 days from the debut, the patient was transitioned to acenocumarol for long-term anticoagulation.
The treatment with acenocumarol was instituted with the heparin overlap until getting the INR therapeutic in the 2-3 intervals.
The evolution was favorable, the patient regaining the verbal fluency and the capacity for autonomy in movement.
The ataxia was remitted at the right limbs and persisted at the left extremities, but registered a lot of improvement.
The patient was discharged home with the recommendation to continue the treatment with Acenocumarol for 6 months with clinical, paraclinical and treatment reevaluation at 6 months.
The follow up was not possible because the patient did not return to the hospital after 6 months.

"A 28-year-old woman was referred with a 4-week history of continuous, moderate right upper quadrant pain associated with jaundice, as well as weight loss (10 kg over 3 months) and a liver mass identified by ultrasonography.
The pain sensation seemed different from previous colicky attacks the patient had experienced before she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 7 years previously.
On physical examination, she was obese (body mass index 37.8), with icterus noted over the conjunctivae, oral mucosa and skin.
Imaging modalities included computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Fig.1).
The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy.
Intraoperative ultrasonography revealed a cystic lesion measuring 3.5 2.5 cm within the central portion of the liver, anterior to the porta hepatis.
Intraoperative cholangiography demonstrated an extensive stricture obliterating the left hepatic duct, with partial occlusion of the right hepatic duct.
An extended left lobectomy was done en bloc with the biliary confluence.
On frozen-section examination, all margins of the excised specimen were free of malignant cells.
Reconstruction was performed with a Roux-en-Y cholangiojejunostomy to 3 second bile duct radicals in the right side.
Intraoperatively, radiotherapy was applied to the surgical margins.
After this, the patient underwent 6 weeks of image-guided external beam radiation centred on the resection field labelled at surgery.
The final pathology described this tumour as an infiltrating, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma associated with severe dysplasia of the bile-duct epithelium (Fig.2).
The patient recovered without complications and was doing well 18 months after the initial surgical procedure, with an unremarkable CT scan.

"A 68-year-old man was referred by his optometrist to HES with suspected LTG due to repeatedly irregular visual field test results, advanced optic disc cupping, normal intraocular pressures (IOPs) and a family history of glaucoma.
The patient subjectively felt that vision in his ‘good’ left eye (LE), which normally had a visual acuity of 6/6 N5, started to deteriorate 6 months earlier; at the point of referral it was best corrected to 6/7.5 N6.
His right eye (RE) was known to be amblyopic with a visual acuity of 6/18 N12.
His medical history included considerable risk factors for systemic vasculopathy, such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, 50 pack-years of smoking and type 2 diabetes with no diabetic retinopathy.
Despite detailed questioning, he denied any new systemic symptoms apart from experiencing increased lethargy.
Clinical examination at HES revealed advanced bilateral cupped optic discs with a cup-to-disc ratio right 0.9 (90%) and left 0.8 (80%; figure 1).
Furthermore, the findings from the referring optometrist of equal and reactive pupils, normal eye movements and IOPs in mid-teens were confirmed.
Computerised perimetry showed constricted visual fields in both eyes, albeit with considerably raised false-negative error rates in excess of 30% (figure 2A).
Since this can be a result of poor concentration and attention span with testing compounded, especially with an amblyopic RE, the field test was repeated 4 weeks later with similar results (figure 2B).
At this visit, the patient experienced further deterioration of his ‘good’ LE.
Visual acuities measured 6/24 (loss of one Snellen line) N36 in his amblyopic RE, and 6/18 (loss of two Snellen lines) N36 in his LE, which now also showed depressed colour vision.
An urgent scan of the patient's head and orbit was requested to rule out a compressive lesion and blood analysis was carried out to screen for other causes of optic neuropathy including vitamin B12, folate levels and inflammatory markers.
MRI revealed a large mass centred at the pituitary fossa measuring approximately 4.5 cm×5.1 cm× 4.8 cm (figure 3A–C) extending into the suprasellar cistern and infrasellar sphenoid sinuses.
The optic chiasm and both optic nerves were displaced superiorly and compressed on both sides.
The mass showed heterogeneous T1 and T2 signals with multiple fluid levels most likely due to previous haemorrhage and low-signal components suggesting calcifications.
The appearance was probably due to a craniopharyngioma or haemorrhagic pituitary adenoma.
The patient was referred urgently to the neurosurgery unit and was found to have markedly raised prolactin levels of greater than 200 000 mIU/L, confirming the diagnosis of a giant prolactinoma.
In cooperation with the local endocrinology service, he was started on cabergoline 500 µg and dexamethasone 8 mg.
Within a week this led to a dramatic improvement of the patient's visual fields and acuities to 6/18 RE and to 6/9 LE.
His prolactin levels showed a similar dramatic response with levels coming down to 336 mIU/L.
Three months later his visual acuity in his RE and LE were 6/18 and 6/5, respectively, and visual field examination showed striking recovery with almost normal results (figure 2C).
"
"A 30-year-old woman with a history of HIV and HCV presented to the emergency department with a 4-month history of gradual but progressive swelling of her lower limbs and abdomen.
She denied any chest pain, dyspnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea or orthopnoea.
Vitals were stable.
Cardiovascular examination was remarkable for an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) of about 12 cm with a pronounced ‘y’ descent.
There was a prominent pericardial knock sound heard over the praecordium.
There was no pericardial rub or murmur.
The lungs were clear to auscultation.
The patient was markedly oedematous from the abdomen to the lower limbs.
She was admitted for further diagnostic work-up and management.
She was diagnosed with HIV around May 2010 and had been on antiretroviral therapy.
She had not used illicit drugs for approximately 5–6 years.
Renal and hepatic diseases were ruled out through blood tests and imaging.
Peritoneal fluid was negative for malignancy.
Echocardiogram showed a thickened bright pericardium adjacent to the right heart border (figure 1) with parallel separation between epicardial and pericardial echoes (railroad track sign), septal bounce and lack of pericardial slide.
Annulus paradoxus was demonstrated on tissue Doppler (figure 2).
Left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%.
The right ventricle was normal in size and function.
There was moderate tricuspid regurgitation.
There was no pericardial effusion, but the pericardial space was remarkable for debris.
Constrictive physiology was demonstrated by Doppler study of tricuspid and mitral inflows (figure 3) during inspiration and expiration; diastolic flow reversal was also demonstrated in the hepatic veins during expiration.
There was marked dilatation of the inferior vena cava with no change during inspiration or expiration.
CT of the chest revealed thickening of the pericardium with no evidence of calcification.
There were no lung nodules.
Bilateral pleural effusions and interstitial thickening were present in the lung bases.
Cardiac MRI confirmed the presence of a diffusely thickened pericardium at 5 mm.
The inferior vena cava and hepatic veins appeared plethoric.
There was a rapid early diastolic filling and associated diastolic septal bounce secondary to hindered late diastolic filling (figure 4).
The patient showed a good response to diuresis.
She underwent right and left heart catheterisation to confirm constrictive physiology.
"
"A 60-year-old white Brazilian man, with controlled hypertension and stage 2 obesity presented to our institution with a complaint of progressive fatigue with moderate to light exertion of approximately 1 year’s duration.
During that period, he had undergone myocardial perfusion scintigraphy without evidence of obstructive ischemic disease.
He had no clinical evidence of systolic heart failure.
He had undergone biological mitral valve replacement 3 years previously for mitral valve stenosis and had undergone ablation of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia 18 months previously.
At the time of valve replacement, there was no reported evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
The patient’s medication list included aspirin 100 mg/day, carvedilol 50 mg/day, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, and losartan 25 mg/day.
His echocardiogram showed normal function of a mitral prosthesis, global left ventricular systolic function within normal limits (left ventricular ejection fraction 62 % measured using the Teichholz method), stage I diastolic dysfunction, and mean pulmonary arterial systolic blood pressure of 50 mmHg.
In the 6-minute walk test, the patient walked 104 meters (Table 1).
Catheterization of his right heart chambers and pulmonary arteries confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (Table 2).
During the follow-up period, therapy with nifedipine and sildenafil was not tolerated secondary to orthostatic hypotension.
The patient was referred for radiofrequency ablation of the pulmonary artery trunk for the treatment of refractory pulmonary hypertension.
The procedure was performed in the catheterization laboratory with direct visualization using fluoroscopy and radiopaque contrast dye.
The patient remained under unconscious sedation.
Catheterization of the right femoral artery via the standard Seldinger technique was performed using an 8-French valved short sheath after subcutaneous injection of a local anesthetic.
Subsequently, this sheath was replaced with a steerable long sheath (Agilis®; St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) using the standard over-the-wire technique.
Unfractionated heparin was administered intravenously, targeting an activated coagulation time between 250 and 350 seconds.
Electroanatomic reconstruction of both the right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary artery was performed using the EnSite Velocity Cardiac Mapping System (St.Jude Medical) under direct fluoroscopic visualization, and a merger was made with the formatted image obtained by performing cardiac computed tomography angiography (Fig.1).
The Agilis® sheath was advanced into the right ventricular outflow tract just before reaching the pulmonary valve.
Through this long sheath, we introduced an ablation catheter with an open irrigated tip (St.Jude Medical).
The parameters used for each application according to our protocol were as follows: power of 5 W, maximum temperature of 48 °C, 60-second duration in each spot, maximum impedance variation of 10 % from baseline values, and an irrigation flow rate of 17 ml/minute, which created a circle in the pulmonary artery trunk.
The patient was discharged the next morning.
No noteworthy changes before or after the procedure or before discharge in the patient’s radiographic or echocardiographic laboratory parameters were seen.
The patient’s blood pressure in both the right heart chambers and the pulmonary artery were determined using catheterization before and at 3 and 6 months after the procedure.
The results are shown in Table 2.
At the patient’s 3-month follow-up examination, he showed an improvement in functional class for fatigue with major exertion.
He also demonstrated an increased distance walked in the 6-minute walk test and reduction of the pressures in both the right cavities and the pulmonary artery.
Currently, with 6 months of clinical follow-up, he has maintained his improvement in functional classification and is pedaling his bicycle.
"
"A 66-year-old man was admitted into our Hospital in November 2008 with splenomegaly, a high red cell count, and subnormal serum erythropoietin levels.
Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal male karyotype.
Molecular studies were negative for the BCR-ABL1 rearrangement, but revealed the JAK2V617F mutation with an allele burden of 44.9%.
A diagnosis of PV was made on the basis of a morphological bone marrow analysis according to the WHO 2008 criteria.
The patient was started on aspirin, hydroxyurea, and phlebotomies, all of which were well tolerated.
Six years later, an abdominal ultrasound scan revealed the presence of dense bilateral perinephric infiltration, which was confirmed by a whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan, and a fluotine-18 fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (F-FDG-PET) scan demonstrated increased glucose uptake in the medullary channels of both humeri and femurs.
Morphological bone marrow analysis confirmed the previous diagnosis of PV and showed no evident change in the grading of bone marrow fibrosis (MF-0 according to the EUMNET consensus),13 whereas cytogenetic analysis revealed the following complex male karyotype: 47,XY,+9[2/20],47,XY,add(6)(p25),+9[2/20],46,XY[16/20].
The histological nature of the perinephric infiltration was identified by means of a CT-guided core biopsy of the lesion.
Morphological analysis demonstrated the accumulation of foamy histiocytes that were positive for CD68 and negative for the dendritic cell markers CD1a and S100, surrounded by fibrosis and a scanty lympho-monocytic infiltrate (Figure ​(Figure1).1).
The detection of the BRAFV600E mutation led to a diagnosis of ECD.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed pseudo-tumoral infiltration of the atrioventricular wall,14 and a bone scan showed symmetrically irregular radiotracer uptake in the long bones of the limbs consistent with ECD (Figure ​(Figure22)2; the findings of cerebral and pulmonary imaging were negative.
In accordance with the most recent guidelines for the treatment of ECD,1 the patient started therapy with pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha and, after 3 months of treatment, a new abdominal ultrasound scan revealed the complete resolution of the dense bilateral perinephric infiltration, and the normalization of the blood cell counts was achieved.
"
"A 56-year-old African American man who initially presented with diarrhea, weight loss and painless jaundice, was subsequently found to have adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas.
An initial workup revealed localized cancer with no evidence of distant metastases.
He then underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete surgical resection of a 5cm moderately differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Although our patient underwent complete surgical resection, a pathological examination revealed a neoplastic invasion of the resected adjacent organs, and one out of the seven resected lymph nodes contained cancer (T3N1M0).
At that point, the oncology department recommended to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 on a 28-day cycle for six cycles) to try to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.
However, after completing two cycles (a total of six doses) of chemotherapy, he presented to the emergency department with worsening exertional dyspnea, three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue.
His physical examination revealed an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) (10cm above the sternal angle), bibasilar rales and +2 pitting edema of both lower extremities.
Cardiac auscultation revealed a gallop rhythm with an S3 and a grade 3 holosystolic murmur over precordium.
A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with mild to moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.
It was thought that his presentation was consistent with fluid overload secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and he was started on intravenous (IV) furosemide with partial improvement in his symptoms.
The next day, a two-dimensional echocardiography (2D Echo) was performed, which showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15 to 20 percent with global hypokinesia along with moderate mitral regurgitation.
Given the findings of 2D Echo and the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP), it was concluded that our patient’s CMP was related to the recent use of gemcitabine.
Our patient was then started on carvedilol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in addition to diuretics and he was discharged from the hospital two days later in a euvolemic state.
At that point, the cardiology department recommended stopping further chemotherapy with gemcitabine.
The oncology department advised further testing to rule out ischemia as a cause of CMP as, in their opinion, chemotherapy with gemcitabine was the only option to reduce the risk of recurrence in this patient.
Two weeks later, our patient underwent myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), which showed a fixed small- to moderate-sized inferior wall defect without any evidence of active ischemia.
The ejection fraction (EF) on MPI was calculated to be around 17 to 20 percent with severe global hypokinesia.
Our patient was continued on standard heart failure therapy with one more admission to the hospital for CHF exacerbation about two months later.
He responded well to IV furosemide and adjustment of heart failure therapy.
A 2D Echo was repeated a few months later and it showed improvement in systolic function with an LVEF of 40 percent.
Due to his poor functional status and underlying CMP, further gemcitabine chemotherapy was stopped.
Later, our patient developed a recurrence of his pancreatic cancer; he refused further chemotherapy and decided to proceed with palliative care.
Although the exact etiology of our patient’s dilated cardiomyopathy remains unclear, gemcitabine remains the most likely culprit.
The temporal relationship of his symptoms to the initiation of gemcitabine chemotherapy; the lack of risk factors for ischemic CMP and prior history of CAD, finding of global hypokinesia on 2D Echo, absence of ischemia on MPI; and improvement in his systolic function after discontinuation of gemcitabine were all consistent with gemcitabine-induced cardiomyopathy.

"A 58-year-old white American male presented to the emergency department (ED) with acute onset of confusion, disorientation, inability to walk steadily, and dehydration with associated generalized weakness, polyuria, and polydipsia over the previous week.
He had been diagnosed with CML six years earlier, with no hematological response to multiple chemotherapy regimens; he was at that time on treatment with allopurinol and awaiting allogenic bone marrow transplant.
Vital signs on admission to the ED included heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mm Hg and temperature of 99.7°F (37.6°C).
There were no remarkable findings on physical examination except for altered mental status and dehydration.
Laboratory evaluations were: hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL, white blood cell count 18.3×109/L (neutrophils 79.6%, lymphocytes 7.2%, and monocytes 8.3%), and platelet count 910×109/L.
Serum levels were: calcium 18.6 mg/dL, phosphate 4.6 mg/dL, sodium 135 mEq/L, potassium 2.7 mg/dL, albumin 4.0 g/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 125 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 41 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase 71 IU/L.
SPEP was negative for an M spike.
Hormones and vitamins levels were: PTH 8.5 pg/L (15–65 pg/L), PHTrP 1.4 pg/L (<2 pg/L), 25-OH vitamin D 30.4 ng/mL (20–50 ng/mL) and 1,25 OH vitamin D3 33.7 ng/mL (18–64) ng/mL.
Chest CT scan showed diffuse lytic lesions and bone destruction throughout the visualized thoracic skeleton, concerning for diffuse bone marrow involvement.
The clinical history and biochemical findings led to a diagnosis of CML-associated hypercalcemia in the context of a blast phase.
Treatment with aggressive hydration with 0.9% saline and calcitonin 400 units subcutaneous was administered.
Additionally, zoledronic acid 3.3 mg intravenous, adjusted for renal insufficiency, was given.
After five days of treatment, normalization of symptoms and serum calcium levels were achieved.
After discharge from the hospital, the patient continued with palliative treatment with ponatinib and radiotherapy.
Acceptable serum calcium levels were maintained with zoledronic acid 4 mg every eight weeks.
Despite these therapies, his cancer progressed and he passed away approximately eight months after the initial admission for hypercalcemia.

"A 42 year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplant in September 2013.
The graft was mismatched at a single human leukocyte antigen allele (DQB1), and was T-cell depleted using in vivo alemtuzumab.
He engrafted on day 12 after transplant.
Aside from persistent lymphopenia and diarrhea from norovirus infection, his posttransplant course was unremarkable until mid-October when he developed tinnitus and rapidly progressive sensorineural deafness, resulting in subtotal hearing loss bilaterally (>95 dB) over 2–3 weeks.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was unremarkable, as was cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (4 leukocytes/µL with 50% neutrophils and 50% lymphocytes, 6 red blood cells/µL, glucose 2.4 mmol/L [normal range, 2.2–4.7 mmol/L], protein 61 mg/dL [normal range, 15–45 mg/L], absence of oligoclonal bands).
Viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of CSF was negative for enterovirus and herpesvirus infection.
The patient was treated empirically with high-dose valacyclovir, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
Despite these interventions, he developed new symptoms of central dyspnea, postural hypotension, nausea, and gradually worsening balance.
Repeat neurological assessment confirmed persistent vestibulocochlear dysfunction 6 weeks after symptom onset.
By mid-December, the patient had become increasingly withdrawn, irritable, and intermittently agitated.
He remained lymphopenic (lymphocytes 0.54 × 106/μL [normal range, 1.2–3.6 × 106/μL]).
MRI scans of the brain were unremarkable, as was serum testing for antineuronal antibodies; an electroencephalogram revealed only diffuse encephalopathy.
Given continued suspicion for a viral etiology, the patient was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids and again with IVIG.
He began refusing fluids, food, and medication, and was detained under the UK Mental Health Act.
Repeat MRI scanning showed interval development of new, nonenhancing signal abnormalities in both thalami and midbrain with cranial nerve involvement but no meningeal enhancement (Figure ​1A).
Near the end of December, a frontal lobe biopsy was performed.
Histology revealed reactive gliosis and diffuse infiltration with CD3+/8+ lymphocytes (Figure 1B).
Extensive microbiological testing of the biopsy tissue for an infectious etiology was negative (Supplementary Table 1).
Given the absence of a diagnosis and the patient's progressive neurological deterioration, CSF and brain biopsy tissue were analyzed in January 2014 by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) [2].
NGS analysis of the brain biopsy, genome assembly, and in situ hybridization revealed findings of neuroinvasive astrovirus (AstV) infection.
Despite lack of approved therapies, the patient was treated with ribavirin and IVIG.
However, he did not respond to these interventions, and remained in a minimally conscious state following withdrawal of sedation in March 2014.
He eventually died at the end of May, 4 months after the NGS diagnosis and approximately 7.5 months after onset of symptoms.

"A 34-year-old Japanese woman had a diagnosis of MCTD with the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon, pancytopenia, elevated plasma creatinine kinase, and antibodies against U1-ribonucleoprotein in 2005 and received 10 mg of prednisolone daily.
Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure estimated by echocardiography was slightly elevated (48 mmHg) in 2006.
She felt progressive shortness of breath on physical effort in 2011.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed with 74 mmHg of mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) evaluated by right heart catheterization (RHC) in 2012.
Cyclophosphamide-based immunosuppressive therapy was proposed but refused because of possible early menopausal symptoms.
Treatment with 250 mg/day of bosentan and 120 μg/day of beraprost was initiated.
However, in January 2014, her dyspnea deteriorated (WHO functional class IV), and she was admitted to our hospital.
A physical examination showed low systemic blood pressure (89/61 mmHg), tachycardia (104/min), low blood oxygen level (percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) 95%), jugular venous distension, and severe systemic edema.
Coarse crackles and loud pulmonic valve closure sounds were detected.
She was unable to undergo the 6-minute walk test due to severe dyspnea.
Laboratory examinations showed elevated plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level (929.4 pg/mL), hypoxemia (PaO2 62.5 mmHg, PaCO2 27.1 mmHg), and the presence of antibodies against U1-ribonucleoprotein (97.9 U/mL) as well as antinuclear antibodies (1:640, speckled pattern).
A chest X-ray showed enlarged pulmonary arteries and cardiomegaly (Figure).
Electrocardiogram showed P wave elevation in the V1-V2 leads.
RHC demonstrated elevated mPAP (65 mmHg) with normal pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (12 mmHg), high pulmonary vascular resistance (1,547 dyne・sec・cm-5), and decreased cardiac output (cardiac index 1.69 L/min/m2).
A ventilation/perfusion scan showed no signs of pulmonary thromboembolism.
No signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung diseases were found with computed tomography.
Her dyspnea was therefore considered to be due to MCTD-associated PAH which was refractory to bosentan and beraprost therapy.
In addition to supportive therapy with oxygen supplementation and diuretics (40 mg/day of furosemide), initiation of 60 mg/day of sildenafil as well as gradual increment in the dose of beraprost was chosen as an additional treatment.
However, her dyspnea remained unchanged, and her plasma BNP level increased.
IVCY (750 mg/m2, every 4 weeks) was initiated, and the dose of prednisolone was increased to 60 mg daily.
Her dyspnea then ameliorated, and she became able to undergo the 6-minute walk test (260 m, minimum SpO2 95 %).
Her plasma BNP level also decreased after the initiation of IVCY (Figure).
Six months after the admission, a follow-up RHC revealed improved mPAP (65 to 53 mmHg), pulmonary vascular resistance (1,547 to 1,116 dyne・sec・cm-5), and cardiac index (1.69 to 1.83 L/min/m2) (Table).
Since she remained stable but did not obtain further improvements 18 months after the admission (Table), we consider parenteral prostanoids or lung transplantation as a subsequent treatment.

"A 51-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to severe congestive heart failure and ventricular arrhythmias in March 2008.
He had been suffering from heart failure and ventricular tachycardia for years despite receiving the conventional treatment (ie, furosemide, lisinopril hydrate, pimobendan, warfarin potassium, carvedilol, metildigoxin and amiodarone hydrochloride).
His height was 161 cm and body weight was 83 kg.
Blood pressure was 110/60 mm Hg.
The fasting blood glucose was 107 mg/dl and HbA1c was 6.3%.
The chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.67 (figure 1A).
ECG, as shown in video 1, revealed a diffused hypokinetic left ventricle with markedly dilated left ventricle dimension (end-diastole: 95 mm) and reduced EF (0.11).
The coronary angiogram was normal.
A myocardial biopsy revealed that over 50% of cardiomyocytes were replaced by fibrosis (figure 2).
An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted.
Due to the typical facial appearance and thickening of hands, he was referred to the endocrinology department.
The plasma level of GH was 8.2 ng/ml and IGF-1 was 504 ng/ml.
MRI demonstrated a macroadenoma in the pituitary.
Thus, he was diagnosed as acromegaly.
He was treated with octreotide long-acting-release (LAR) for 8 months.
Thereafter, he underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery in January 2009 (figure 3).
The plasma levels of GH and IGF-1 were decreased with octreotide LAR, but basal plasma levels of GH were always more than 4 ng/ml and plasma IGF-1 levels were above the appropriate age range (figure 3).
After surgery, both plasma levels of GH and IGF-1 further decreased.
Basal plasma levels of GH were mostly less than 0.5 ng/ml and IGF-1 levels were within normal ranges (figure 3).
With the treatment of LAR, the cardiac function improved partially (cardiothoracic ratio=0.58; EF=0.20 in September 2008).
After surgery, the cardiac function improved drastically (cardiothoracic ratio=0.47; EF=0.55 in April 2009; figures 1B and ​and2B).2B).
Frequency of ventricular arrhythmias decreased and pimobendan was tapered off.
"
"A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation of stuttering chest pain for 10 days, and he was a common worker.
There was no positive finding from the relevant physical examination.
He has no medical, family, and psychosocial history including co-morbidities, and relevant genetic information.
His electrocardiogram showed T-wave inversion over leads V1 to V4 (Figure ​1).
Coronary angiography showed 90% stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), which was stented (Figure 2).
T-wave still inversion over leads V1 to V4 after the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (Figure ​3).
The patient discharged after the PCI in 5 days and recharged in the hospital because of a palpation.
His electrocardiogram demonstrated ventricular tachycardia (Figure ​4), and severe hypertension, remarkable blood pressure fluctuation between 224/76 and 70/50 mm Hg.
Although several antihypertensive drugs were used, ventricular tachycardia still occurred on him for 2 times, each was preceded by a period of blood pressure fluctuation and burst out concomitantly at the peak of a hypertension crisis.
The patient felt abdominal pain and his abdominal ultrasound showed suspicious right adrenal gland tumor.
Enhanced computed tomography of adrenal gland conformed that there was a tumor in right adrenal gland accompanied by an upset level of aldosterone (Figure 5).
The tumor was removed by laparoscope, and pathological examination showed pheochromocytoma (Figure ​6).
After the surgery, the blood pressure turned normal gradually.
There was no T-wave inversion in lead V1-V4 (Figure ​7).

"A 73-year-old woman was initially referred 19 months prior to the current presentation, at which time fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography showed a medium-sized subfoveal classic CNV in the left eye, which had not been previously treated.
She did not return for treatment until the current presentation, when she noted decreased vision in the left eye.
The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/100.
Slit lamp examination showed a small yellowish patch in the perifoveal region and retinal edema.
Structural OCT revealed the retinal elevation, subretinal fluid and a hyper-reflective elongated area above RPE indicating type II CNV.
Anti-angiogenic treatment with intravitreal aflibercept injections were administered with a treat-and-extend regimen.
OCT angiograms (Fig.1) showed noticeable reduction in CNV flow area by 1–2 days post injection, with continued reduction at 1 week and 2 weeks.
CNV flow area and vessel density were reduced, probably due to the decreased flow or temporary closure of the smaller anastomoses.
Significant re-appearance of CNV was noticeable at 4 weeks after the first injection and again at 6 weeks after the second injection.
The vascular pattern of the re-enlarged CNV (Fig.1A) was very similar to the initial pretreatment CNV, suggesting that the recurrence may be reopening of original channels rather than growth of new vessels.
Comparing the CNV network prior to the 3rd injection to the baseline, it is notable that there were fewer smaller channels, while the larger caliber channels remained.
Quantitative measurements from OCT angiography (Fig.2A) showed reduction in CNV flow area and flow index over the first 2 weeks with subsequent return.
Retinal thickness (Fig.2B) showed the fluid resorption over the first 4 weeks in the first treatment cycle continuing at least 2 weeks into the second treatment cycle, at which time no fluid remained (Fig.1B).
But fluid re-accumulated under the retina 6 weeks after the 2nd injection.
Visual acuity (Fig.2B) continued to improve over the 3 treatment cycles.

"A 24-year-old Malay male patient was referred to the respiratory clinic because of an abnormal pre-employment chest radiograph.
He had been smoking about 10 cigarettes a day since he was 21 years of age.
He stopped smoking 10 months ago after he noticed he had being having reduced effort tolerance for the past three years.
He was an office worker and did not have a history of exposure to organic or inorganic dusts.
His two siblings were asymptomatic.
On examination, the patient was not tachypnoeic.
There were no signs of finger clubbing or pulmonary hypertension.
His oxygen saturation on room air at rest was 94% and dropped to 92% after climbing up four flights of stairs.
Spirometry testing revealed a restrictive pattern of lung disease with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 2.7 L (69% of predicted) and 3.2 L (68% of predicted), respectively.
The FEV1/FVC ratio was 85%.
His haemoglobin (168 g/L), serum parathyroid hormone (2.9 pmol/L [normal, 1.1-7.3]) and calcium (2.34 mmol/L) levels were normal.
24-hour urine calcium was also normal 6.9 mmol with a 24-hour urine volume of 2.8 L.
His chest radiograph (Fig.1A) revealed dense micronodular opacities distributed symmetrically and predominantly in the middle to lower zones of both lungs giving the classical ""sandstorm"" appearance.
The cardiac borders were obscured by the sand-like opacities.
A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs (Fig.1B) showed widespread tiny microcalcifications throughout the lungs with a preponderance of microliths in the lower lobes.
There were associated areas of interlobular septal thickening and ground-glass changes.
Subpleural cystic changes were also seen in both lower lobes giving rise to the 'black pleura sign' (Fig.1C) (2).
No pneumothorax or pleural effusion was present.
Both the bronchial system (including the small bronchioles) and the size of the pulmonary vessels were normal.
As this was diffuse parenchymal lung disease, videoassisted thoracic surgical (VATS) lung biopsy was planned but the procedure was converted into a mini-thoracotomy because there was difficulty in manoeuvering the endostapler.
There was a moderate pneumothorax postmini-thoracotomy from which the patient fully recovered after 5 days in the ward.
The lung biopsy specimen revealed features consistent with PAM, with numerous calcospherites within the alveolar spaces (Fig.1D).
The intervening alveolar septae were congested and showed mild fibrosis with infiltrates of mainly lymphoplasmacytic cells.

"A 68-year-old female smoker with a history of pulmonary embolism and diabetes mellitus was diagnosed with Stage IIIB (T4N2M0) squamous NSCLC.
She was treated by definitive chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and vinorelbine until September 2014.
In October 2014, positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan demonstrated a good response in the primary lesion; however, new metastases in the right adrenal gland and right femur developed and were irradiated in November 2014.
A month later the disease progressed with development of multiple bone and subcutaneous metastases.
At that point, the patient suffered from severe dyspnea and was oxygen-dependent.
She received one cycle of carboplatin and gemcitabine followed by severe pancytopenia, and treatment was switched to nivolumab 3 mg/kg q14 days in January 2015.
One week after the first cycle of nivolumab, a subcutaneous lesion in her upper back grew substantially, accompanied by severe pain and significant inflammatory reaction (Fig.1).
Other subcutaneous metastases grew slightly as well.
After the second cycle of treatment marked symptomatic improvement was observed, including improvement in general appearance and dyspnea and reduction of the bone pain.
The patient no longer required oxygen supplementation.
The subcutaneous lesions started to regress too, with complete resolution by the 12th week as well as improvement in all bone lesions (Figs.1 ​and 2).
The patient continued on nivolumab until June 2015, and tolerated the treatment well.
Unfortunately, she developed bacterial aspiration pneumonia and passed away in June 2015.

"A 53-year-old woman presented to our institution with progressive abdominal distention and irregular vaginal bleeding of several weeks’ duration.
A contrast CT abdomen and pelvis revealed an ill-defined, irregular mass in the lower uterine/cervical region (Figure 1).
There were multiple peritoneal and omental masses, enlarged pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes, and large-volume ascites.
The initial CBC was significant for hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, leukocytosis of 36 790 per microliter, and thrombocytosis of 625 000 per microliter.
Serum calcium was elevated at 13.1 mg/dL.
BUN and creatinine were within normal limits.
Hepatic function was within normal limits.
A pelvic exam revealed a fungating vaginal mass.
The patient underwent biopsies of the endometrium and the vaginal mass, which revealed a high-grade tumor with predominantly oval-shaped cells.
Immunohistochemical staining was positive for vimentin, CD10, and cyclin D1, consistent with a diagnosis of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (Figure 2).
The tumor was negative for ER, with rare cells positive for PR.
Although immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins was negative, a biphasic component could not be entirely ruled out given the small size of the biopsy specimen relative to the tumor.
The patient’s Ca125 was markedly elevated at 1624 U/mL (nl ≤34).
Contrast CT chest revealed a right-sided pleural effusion but no suspicious nodules or lymphadenopathy.
The patient was deemed to have operable disease and was scheduled for debulking surgery.
However, preoperative laboratory studies showed that her serum calcium had further increased to 19.2 mg/dL.
She had also developed evidence of acute kidney injury, with her BUN rising to 37 mg/dL and creatinine to 1.81 mg/dL.
On physical exam, she was noted to be lethargic, with dry mucous membranes.
The surgery was cancelled due to the patient’s medical instability.
Further workup revealed an elevated PTHrP of 301 pg/mL (nl 14–27), a depressed PTH level of 3 pg/mL (nl 15–65), and a depressed 25-OH vitamin D level of 16 ng/mL (nl 30–100), consistent with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.
The patient was treated with pamidronate, calcitonin, and intravenous fluids.
She eventually required temporary hemodialysis and denosumab for refractory hypercalcemia.
The patient improved with regard to her electrolyte abnormalities.
Given the extent of her disease, she was planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery if a good response was achieved.
She was started on a regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel, which she received for 3 cycles.
She also had palliative radiation to the uterus to control bleeding.
However, her disease failed to respond significantly to chemotherapy, and she ultimately died from complications of malignancy.

"A 65-year-old man was admitted to the China-Japan Friendship hospital with a chief complaint of progressive dysphagia for 3 mo.
He also complained of a drastic weight loss of 8 kg in the past 2 mo.
He denied a history of smoking, alcohol intake and substance abuse, but had a chronic atrophic gastritis for nearly 10 years.
Also, there was no family history of genetic defect or malignancy.
Physical examination showed no palpable findings.
Admission blood test showed a slight decrease in hemoglobin (106 g/L).
Upper gastrointestinal (GI) examination using barium contrasts showed a large tumor blocking the esophago-gastric junction (Figure ​1).
Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a soft mass in the esophago-gastric junction with lymph node metastasis in the lesser curvature of the stomach (Figure ​2).
Endoscopic examination showed a black spot in the lower esophagus and a bulky black mass blocking the esophago-gastric junction, as well as two black crater-like ulcers in the fundus of the stomach (Figure ​3).
Biopsy specimens taken from the tumor were identified as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
Preoperative nutrition status of this case was scored 2 based on the Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002)[6].
Because of the obstructive symptom caused by the tumor, a debulking surgery of distal esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy was performed.
Esophagogastric anastomosis and reconstruction was then completed with stapling device.
Intraoperatively, the tumor was found located at the esophago-gastric junction and the tumor infiltrated the whole layer with lymph node metastasis at station four.
No ascites or dissemination of the tumor was observed in the peritoneal cavity.
The tumor measured 3 cm × 6 cm in size with black pigmentation (Figure ​4).
There were several pigmented satellite nodules beside the main tumor lesion, the largest one being 1 cm × 1 cm in diameter.
Moreover, two ulceration lesions were found at the fundus of the stomach.
Microscopically, the excised tumor tissue was composed of non-organized and pleomorphic cells exhibiting atypical nuclei, and abundant melanin granules (Figure ​5).
Pathological examination identified this case at a stage of IVA (T4aN1M0).
Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor was positive for S-100, HMB-45, mclean-A and Vimentin, but negative for cytokeratin 7 and cytokeratin 20 (Figure ​6).
Based on these results, a diagnosis of primary advanced esophago-gastric melanoma was established.
The postoperative course was smooth and without complications.
The patient gradually recovered and was discharged 14 d after surgery.
As the patient denied a postoperative adjuvant therapy, abdominal recurrence and hepatic metastases were found within one month by a postoperative follow-up CT.
No other effective treatment was administered afterwards.
The patient died of diffuse metastatic disease 2 mo later.
"
"A 54-year-old patient was admitted for fever, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
He had no significant medical history, did not take any medication, and had not traveled recently.
He had no relevant familial history.
Fifteen days before his admission, he developed fever, fluctuant rash, diarrhea, and pain in the joints.
On admission, blood pressure was 140/70 mm Hg, temperature 39°C.
Physical examination showed severe edema involving both lower and upper limbs, as well as ascites and pleural effusion.
Cervical and axillar infracentimetric lymphadenopathies were present, together with hepatosplenomegaly, confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan.
Bilateral arthritis of the ankles resolved spontaneously.
Blood analysis revealed (Table ​(Table1):1): leukocytosis, normal hemoglobin and platelet levels with no biologic sign of hemolysis, elevated C-reactive protein, low albumin, elevated serum creatinin, mild proteinuria and no hematuria.
Despite intravenous rehydration using saline and albumin, renal function worsened and the patient required dialysis.
While diagnostic investigations were performed, hemiplegia occurred: brain MRI showed multifocal ischemic lesions.
Echographic and rythmologic studies ruled out any cardiologic cause for the stroke.
A renal biopsy was performed (Fig.1A and B).
Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining showed endotheliosis in all glomeruli (Fig.1A, arrows), associated with mesangiolysis and double contours on silver staining (Fig.1B, arrows), and no arteriolar thrombus.
A moderate CD20+ B lymphocyte infiltrate was present in the interstitium, with a peritubularcapillaritis.
Immunofluorescence study did not show any deposit.
Lymph node biopsy (Fig.2A and B) showed abnormal follicles with hyalinization of germinal center, and an onion-skin aspect of the mantle zone.
Clinical presentation and lymph node histology were consistent with hyaline-vascular multicentric Castleman disease (MCD).
HIV and HHV-8 serology, as well as HHV-8 lymph node tissue staining, were negative.
Serum vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) was highly elevated.
There was no biologic manifestation of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), but the renal biopsy and brain MRI were consistent with glomerular and neurologic TMA lesions.
No other apparent cause of thrombotic microvascular involvement was noted.
Notably, there was no evidence for infection with shiga toxin-producing germs, ADAMTS-13 activity was decreased up to 14% but remained above 5%, and the alternative complement pathway was normal.
Plasma exchange was initiated due to the kidney histological lesions and the multifocal ischemic brain lesions.
It was discontinued after 1 month after the onset of the disease, since the patient's condition remained stable.
Furthermore, chemotherapy including 6 courses of rituximab (375 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m2), and dexamethasone (40 mg/day from day 1 to day 4) was started together with plasma exchanges (chemotherapy was performed immediately after plasma exchanges).
Courses were performed every 3 weeks.
Clinical manifestations of vascular leak syndrome regressed, renal function normalized, and serum VEGF level decreased to 825 pg/mL after 1 course of chemotherapy.
The patient was discharged 43 days after admission.
No neurological event occurred after initiating the treatment.
Thoraco-abdominal CT scan was performed after 6 courses of chemotherapy, showing a normal liver and spleen size and no lymph node enlargement.
One year after the diagnosis, remission of MCD is persistent and plasma creatinine is 86 μmol/L, with no proteinuria.
"
"A 46-year-old Caucasian woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and bipolar disorder presented to our emergency department with vague abdominal symptoms and vomiting.
Her pertinent history includes left below knee amputation and right toes amputation for complications secondary to diabetic neuropathy.
At the time of admission, she was undergoing care for an infected diabetic ulcer of her right foot.
Of note, she did not have a history of CAPD or a history of renal disease: creatinine 1.23 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL.
Her blood glucose levels were poorly controlled via subcutaneous insulin injection; she reported a range of 400 to 500 mg/dL at home (due to poor drug compliance).
Her blood glucose levels were decreased to a range of 175 to 378 mg/dL after implementation of a stricter insulin regimen upon admission.
A non-contrast CT scan showed confluent, bilobar geographic regions of hypoattenuation in a subcapsular distribution throughout her liver (Fig.1).
A MRI liver protocol was performed for further evaluation of these indeterminate findings to assess for possible vascular etiology as areas of infarction could also be possible in this patient.
In-phase gradient echo images demonstrated hyperintense foci in her liver in a distribution corresponding to the hypoattenuating regions seen on CT.
On the opposed-phase sequence, there was loss in signal within these areas indicating the presence of intracellular fat and water (Fig.2).
In addition, these areas were hypointense to the remaining hepatic parenchyma on the fat suppression MR sequences, confirming presence of fat and thus establishing a diagnosis of SHS.
Furthermore, a follow-up CT of her abdomen and pelvis was performed 3 months later, which showed near complete resolution of these findings (Fig.3).
Of note, stricter glucose control had decreased her average blood glucose level to below 200 mg/dL.
"
"A 65-year old female was admitted with progressive dysphagia for 2 months and 5 kg weight loss.
Her past medical history was significant for osteoporosis treated with calcium lactate tablets, daily, for 5 years.
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy described a 4 cm whitish firm mass in the middle esophagus (Fig.1) and a semi-circumferential deep ulcer with irregular borders on the opposite mucosa (Fig.2).
During endoscopy a pedicle was not identify by handling a polipectomy snare around the esophageal mass.
Upper gastrointestinal series with gastrografin (Fig.3) revealed an ovoid lacunar image at the distal part of the esophagus esophageal, inhomogeneous, with calcifications and smooth contours.
During peristalsis the image was mobile and no pedicle was identified.
The esophageal lumen was enlarged with a diverticula development at the posterior wall.
Also computer tomography of the thorax excluded a pedunculated tumor, describing an intra-luminal calcified esophageal mass (Fig.4).
The biopsies obtained from the esophageal ulcerated mucosa revealed inflammatory cells, without malignancy.
Based on these endoscopic and imagistic results a bezoar was supposed to have been developed in an esophageal diverticula, subsequently with ulcerated mucosa.
The esophageal mass was removed with an endoscopic snare in one piece, as the fragmentation was not physically possible.
The macroscopic appearance revealed a 4 cm, globular mass, heterogeneous, dense, whitish, in places with harsh yellow foci, most likely dystrophic calcification.
The macroscopic examination on cross section revealed a light gray aspect (fibrous appearance) that includes multiple harsh yellow-orange structures, difficult to section (Fig.5).
This mass was immersed into trichloracetic acid for decalcification.
Microscopic examination revealed hyaline fibrous tissue (Fig.6a), stained in green in Tricrom Mason (Fig.6b), with numerous crystalline basophils deposits of minerals, rare fibrocytes and very few vessels.
The presence of capillary structures, rare fibroblasts and collagen fibers brought in discussion a mesenchymal originating mass, most likely a fibrovascular polyp.
A definitive histological diagnosis was not possible, as the pedicle was not identified, but the presence of the connective tissue suggested the previous presence of a pedicle into the lesion.
The long term calcium tablets intake might explain the calcification process developed into the vascular-connective tissue, revealed on histology by the numerous crystalline basophils deposits of minerals.
One month later the patient was asymptomatic.
The endoscopy did not revealed an enlarged esophagus, the appearance of the esophageal mucosa was normal (without ulcerations) and no diverticula was identified.
No motility disturbances were found on esophageal manometry.
Based on the clinical course, the history of calcium lactate intake and histological appearance a diagnosis of an esophageal benign mesenchymal originating mass (most probably a fibrovascular polyp) auto-amputated and calcified was formulated.
"
"A 60-year-old male patient had previously undergone a radical resection of a T2bN0M0G3 Stage III retroperitoneal sarcoma, including right nephrectomy and cholecystectomy, in 2002.
Pathologic evaluation demonstrated a 25 cm high-grade liposarcoma with different histologic components, including myxoid, round cell, well-differentiated, sclerosing and pleomorphic patterns.
Surgical margins were negative as the tumor did not invade the kidney, and since the renal vein and ureter were free of tumor as well.
The patient did not undergo any additional therapy.
Surveillance magnetic resonance imaging in 2007 revealed an isolated tumor recurrence in the retroperitoneum.
An exploratory celiotomy revealed tumor involvement of the duodenum, head of the pancreas, superior mesenteric vein, vena cava and left renal vein with severe adhesive changes, leading to the intraoperative assessment of unresectable disease.
Subsequently, the patient underwent stereotactic body radiation to the retroperitoneal tumor in five fractions for a total dose of 30 Gy, without complication.
Postradiation imaging revealed near complete resolution of the retroperitoneal mass.
One year later, the patient presented with weight loss, postprandial abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.
Cross-sectional imaging revealed a 7 cm mass with involvement of the third portion of the duodenum (Figure ​1).
However, there was no obvious involvement of the pancreatic head or the other structures that were noted to be involved during the previous laparotomy.
We elected to perform another resection attempt, including a possible pancreatoduodenectomy or retroperitoneal vascular resection if necessary.
At exploration, the residual tumor was an entirely intraduodenal, pedunculated mass at the posterior duodenal wall distal to the ampulla that filled the entire duodenal lumen.
The patient underwent a duodenotomy and stalk transection of the polypoid mass, followed by partial duodenal resection with hand-sewn duodenojejunal anastomosis (Figure 2).
Surgical pathology examination revealed a 9.5 cm recurrent high-grade liposarcoma with polypoid intraluminal growth containing myxoid, round cell, well-differentiated, sclerosing and focally pleomorphic areas.
Surgical margins were negative as the tumor came within 0.1 cm of the stalk margin and there was no evidence of additional neoplastic components within the remaining resected duodenum.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated, and the patient has demonstrated no recurrence up to 30 months from this resection.
"
"A 69-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presented with a generalized petechial rash and shortness of breath of 3 days duration.
The rash was nonpruritic, painless, and started at the thighs, but rapidly disseminated to the rest of the body.
She had progressive dyspnea on exertion, with a significant decrease in exercise tolerance.
She denied fever, headache, dizziness, hemoptysis, or bleeding from anywhere.
There was no history of new drug use, unusual food intake, contact with any sick persons, or recent travel.
Her only medication was enalapril, which she had been taking for several years.
The patient denied any use of recreational drugs, tobacco, or alcohol.
On admission, she was afebrile, normotensive with mild tachypnea (respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute).
Physical examination revealed scattered petechial rash, more prominent in lower extremities, nonpalpable and nonblanching.
Chest auscultation revealed coarse crackles bilaterally.
Cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examinations were normal.
There was no palpable lymphadenopathy or visceromegaly.
Laboratory examination revealed thrombocytopenia (platelets 7000/μL), anemia (hemoglobin 10.8 mg/dL and hematocrit 34%), and leukocytosis (white blood cells [WBCs] 11,600/μL).
The coagulation profile was normal, which excluded disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Arterial blood gas on ambient air revealed a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 64 Torr, a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 Torr (pH 7.45), and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient (44 Torr).
Diffuse airspace consolidation was found on chest roentgenogram (Fig.1A).
Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed diffuse ground glass alveolar opacities and patchy infiltrates (Fig.1B, C).
She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and received intravenous steroids.
Peripheral smear showed giant platelets and occasional small platelet clumps, with no schistocytes.
A flexible fiber-optic bronchoscopy (FFB) showed normal mucosa with no endobronchial lesions (Fig.2A).
Serial aliquots of BAL fluid (BALF) turned more hemorrhagic, confirming the bronchoscopic diagnosis of DAH (Fig.2B).
Cytology of BALF showed a substantial amount of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, further supporting the diagnosis.
All BALF cultures and gram stains were negative.
The patient remained with severe thrombocytopenia and hypoxia despite steroids and platelets transfusion.
High doses of pulse steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) were added with clinico-radiological improvement.
A bone marrow aspirate was morphologically normal.
Additional laboratory studies failed to reveal an etiology for secondary thrombocytopenia (Table ​1), supporting the diagnosis of ITP.
Steroids were gradually tapered.
Repeat chest radiograph showed almost complete resolution of bilateral infiltrates (Fig.3).
Platelet count returned to normal by week 10 after admission without any additional therapies (Fig.4).

"A 71-year-old African-American woman presented to the hospital with worsening exertional dyspnoea associated with orthopnoea and lower extremity oedema for 3 weeks.
She had a long-standing history of hypertension and documented G6PD deficiency with prior episodes of haemolysis.
She was a former cigarette smoker and had family members with G6PD deficiency, hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
Vital signs measurement revealed a blood pressure of 150/73 mm Hg, pulse rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, temperature of 36.6°C and 97% saturation on room air.
She was comfortable at rest.
Her physical examination showed distended jugular veins, inspiratory crackles in bilateral lung bases, a laterally displaced apical impulse and bipedal oedema.
The ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and inferolateral T-wave inversions.
Chest radiography revealed cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary oedema.
The metabolic panel and troponin levels were normal but the B-type natriuretic peptide was increased at 826.5 pg/mL.
Echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30% and mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction.
Coronary artery catheterisation revealed normal coronary circulation.
Ethacrynic acid at 50 mg daily was chosen for diuresis.
She improved after a day but still had dyspnoea, so we added spironolactone.
Subsequently, metoprolol succinate and losartan were included in the regimen.
Repeat chest radiography showed resolution of pulmonary oedema.
The patient's laboratory results during her hospital stay did not show signs of haemolysis nor worsening kidney function.
She did not develop ototoxicity and was discharged home asymptomatic.
"
"A 36-year-old female presented at the emergency department with aggravating right upper abdominal pain for 2 hours.
The patient was diagnosed hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier for several years and non-alcoholics.
No other specific personal and familial medical history was noted.
Initial blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, pulse rate 70/min, respiration rate 20/min, body temperature 37.5℃.
The laboratory findings were white blood cell 12,000/mm3 (poly: 70%), hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, platelet 198,000/mm3, prothrombin time 14.3 seconds, international normalized ratio 1.11, aspartate aminotransferase 22 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase 12 IU/L, total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 134 IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 295 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 26 IU/L, protein/albumin 6.4/4.0 g/dL, uric acid 5.0 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 16.6/0.7 mg/dL.
And serum viral markers were HBsAg (+), anti-HBs (-), anti-HBc (+), HBeAg (-), anti-HBe (+), HBV-DNA <20 IU/mL, anti-HCV (-) and anti-HIV (-).
The patient's serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) was 676.5 ng/mL and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) <0.6 U/mL.
She took an abdominal CT scan, which showed a 9 cm sized necrotic mass with internal hemorrhage at the right hepatic lobe and ruptured to peritoneum (Fig.1A), so an emergency hepatic central bisectionectomy was done (Fig.2A).
The initial histological diagnosis was cHCC-CC with spindle cell metaplasia of cholangiocarcinoma element (Fig.2B).
The serum AFP was decreased to 7.67 ng/mL at time of discharge.
Regarding as cHCC-CC, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with tegafur/uracil (UFT) was administrated for 3 months.
3 months later, follow-up abdominal CT scanning showed previously unseen a 5.5 cm sized left subphrenic mass with mild enhancement in delayed image (Fig.3A, B) and AFP was increased to 312.06 ng/mL.
She underwent laparoscopic splenectomy with mass excision.
On histologic examination, mesenchymal elements consisted of a proliferation of primitive-appearing mesenchymal spindle-shaped cells, intimately admixed with the epithelial elements in a highly cellular pattern.
Cytoplasm was more abundant than that of mature fibroblasts, and the nucleus was elongated and plump.
These cells blended progressively with areas of less intense cellular mesenchymal proliferation, and with relatively acellular, fibrous septa.
Osteoid was present either within the primitive mesenchyme, near the fibrous septa or pseudocapsule, or admixed within the epithelial elements.
Osteoid foci contained cells morphologically identical to osteoblasts (Fig.4A).
The immunohistochemistry stains showed expression of hepatocyte, β-HCG, AFP, vimentin, CK7, CK19, CD56 and β-catenin and negativity for CEA.(Fig.4B, C, D, E, F, G).
Metastatic hepatoblastoma was confirmed by histologic examination with immunohistochemistry stains, so immunohistochemistrically re-examination of previous surgical specimens was also confirmed as hepatoblastoma.
Follow-up abdominal CT scan performed 1 month after reoperation showed a newly onset 1.7 cm sized subtle enhancing soft tissue mass in splenic bed, and positron emission tomography (PET) showed multiple FDG uptake(max SUV > 3.80) in left upper and lower quadrant area of abdomen, paralumbar area including right subphrenic area (Fig.5A, B, C).
Follow-up AFP was 162.69 ng/mL.
Systemic chemotherapy started with cisplatin (60 mg/m2), 5-fluorourasil (5-FU) (600 mg/m2), vincristine (1.5 mg/m2) and total 3 cycles of chemotherapy were done every 4 week.
Entecavir 0.5 mg was also started for chemoprophylaxis of CHB.
After the 3rd chemotherapy cycle, follow-up abdominal CT and PET scan showed progression of multiple intraperitoneal metastasis with large amount of intraperitoneal fluid (Fig.6A, B) and follow-up AFP was further increased to 254 ng/mL.
So chemotherapy regimen was changed to carboplatin (350 mg/m2) with doxorubicin (30 mg/m2) every 3 weeks.
The patient experienced neutropenia after the new regimen, but recovered shortly after treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).
After second carboplatin with doxorubicin chemotherapy, follow-up AFP was increased 1510.19 ng/mL, but abdominal CT scan showed that amount of ascites was decreased (Fig.7).
Because of radiologic improvements, third and fourth chemotherapy were performed.
After 4th chemotherapy, follow-up abdominal CT revealed progression of multiple intraperitoneal metastatic masses, newly developed hepatic metastasis and large amount of intraperitoneal fluid (Fig.8).
A diagnostic paracentesis was performed and showed white blood cell 310/mm3 (poly 20%, lymph 80%), protein 3.6 g/dL and albumin 2.3 g/dL on ascitic fluid analysis.
The serum albumin was 3.1 g/dL and serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was 0.8 g/dL.
The AFB stain and culture were all negative in ascitic fluid.
The AFP was 6881.93 ng/mL on serum.
Regarded as peritoneal carcinomatosis, the patient underwent conservative treatments including the use of repeated therapeutic paracentesis for 1 month before death.
"
"A 60-year-old Caucasian woman with no significant medical history developed exercise intolerance, fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion over the several months prior to her presentation to our outpatient clinic.
At the time of presentation, she also reported of dry cough, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, generalised weakness and intermittent numbness of her hands and feet.
Social history was negative for smoking, alcohol or illicit drugs.
Physical examination was unremarkable, except for jugular venous distension, audible S1 and S2 sounds, bilateral crackles on lung auscultation and bilateral pitting oedema.
Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema and small-sized bilateral pleural effusions.
A 12-lead ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, low-voltage complexes and extreme right-axis deviation (figure 1).
Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) demonstrated asymmetric biventricular hypertrophy with preserved ejection fraction of 60%, elevated right-ventricular systolic pressure of 36 mm Hg and abnormal myocardial texture, described as ‘granular sparkling’ (figure 2).
Coronary CT angiogram demonstrated normal coronary arteries.
Subsequently, cardiac MRI demonstrated early and diffuse subendocardial delayed enhancement, concerning for infiltrative myocardial disease and for diffuse biventricular hypertrophy, with normal ejection fraction (figure 3).
The patient underwent right heart catheterisation with endomyocardial biopsy, revealing diffuse amyloidosis with amorphous proteinaceous material around cardiac myocytes and within blood vessels, which was positive for Congo red stain (figure 4).
Subsequent laboratory evaluation registered elevated, free λ light chains (86.3 mg/L (normal: 5.7–26.3 mg/L)) and positive Bence-Jones protein (0.37 g/24 h) in the urine.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed greater than 10% infiltration of CD19− CD56+ CD138+ plasma cells with reversal of marrow κ/λ ratio (<1:2, normal: 2:1), consistent with MM.
The patient was eventually diagnosed with systemic AL amyloidosis with advanced, stage III, cardiac amyloidosis due to underlying MM.
Given her advanced cardiac amyloidosis, the patient was deemed a poor candidate for autologous stem-cell transplantation.
The patient was started on systemic chemotherapy with melphalan and dexamethasone.
Despite receiving standard therapy for heart failure—including diuretics, β-blockers and ACE inhibitors—the patient's condition continued to worsen and she succumbed to sudden cardiac death.

"A 54 year-old diabetic woman complained of blurred vision in the left eye for 5 days without scalp tenderness or headache.
Visual acuity (VA) was 20/20 right eye and 20/30 left eye.
Intraocular pressures were normal.
Funduscopic examination revealed left optic nerve edema and a small disc margin hemorrhage.
WBC count was 12,700, ESR was 7 (normal 0–20 mm/hr) and CRP was 2.4 (normal 0–1.0 mg/dL).
Three days later, she noted new left eye pain and her vision declined to counting fingers.
There was no pain on eye movement.
The right pupil was 4 mm and reacted to light; the left pupil was 4 mm, and there was a relative left afferent pupillary defect.
The left optic nerve was swollen with a few peripapillary nerve fiber layer hemorrhages along with a cherry red spot and mild macular edema consistent with central retinal artery occlusion; there were no posterior pole or peripheral retinal hemorrhages.
Trace cells were seen in the anterior chamber, but not in the vitreous fluid.
Repeat WBC, ESR and CRP were normal.
Treponemal and Bartonella antibodies, the QuantiFERON-TB test, blood cultures, EKG and carotid Doppler ultrasound were unremarkable.
Brain contrast MRI demonstrated no optic nerve enhancement.
Twelve days later, left eye pain and vision worsened, and the patient complained of jaw claudication and scalp pain.
VA declined to no light perception in the left eye with 1+ cells and flare in anterior chamber and 2+ vitreous cells and haze.
Funduscopic examination revealed extensive retinal necrosis and diffuse hemorrhages with multiple areas of focal venous beading (Fig.1), consistent with acute retinal necrosis.
Vitreous fluid was examined by PCR for amplifiable HSV, VZV, CMV and toxoplasma sequences and returned positive for VZV DNA.
She was treated with a one-time intravitreal injection of ganciclovir 2000 mcg/0.5 ml in the left eye, oral acyclovir 800 mg 5 times daily for 14 days and oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 7 days followed by 20 mg for 7 days.
Eleven days after starting treatment, because she had recently developed jaw claudication and intermittent scalp pain, a temporal artery biopsy was performed.
Histological examination was normal (Fig.2) while immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated VZV antigen in the arterial adventitia; evaluation of adjacent sections for HSV-1 antigen and infiltrating leukocytes (CD45, not shown) was negative (Fig.3).
Antiviral therapy was altered to intravenous acyclovir, 10 mg/kg every 8 h for 14 days, and steroids were discontinued.

"An 84-year-old male patient with a history of coronary artery disease and right coronary artery (RCA) stenting was admitted to our university hospital in February 2012 because of progressive dyspnoea and recurring syncopes.
Cardiological work-up revealed a grade III severe symptomatic aortic stenosis.
Due to relevant comorbidities (logistic EuroSCORE of 19 points) and severe femoral arteriopathy, he was scheduled for trans-subclavian TAVI.
After successful implantation of a CoreValve prosthesis (Medtronic) [Medtronic World Headquarters Medtronic Parkway Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA] (diameter 31 mm) and initial discharge, he was referred back to the hospital because of dyspnoea due to bilateral pleural effusions.
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed a severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which was subsequently treated by interventional mitral valve repair using the MitraClip (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, U.S.A.) and procedurally dependent atrial septal defect (ASD) closure AMPLATZER™ PFO Occluder (St.
Jude Medical GmbH, Helfmann-Park 7, Eschborn, Germany).
Two weeks after secondary discharge, the patient developed progressive heart failure in combination with acute renal failure.
Immediate echocardiography revealed a moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation and recurrent severe MR.
Valvular defects resulted from a slight but significant aortic valve prosthesis migration towards the left ventricular outflow tract, which had caused aortic paravalvular leakage and partial posterior mitral leaflet detachment (Fig.1).
As a consequence of these findings, the patient was transferred to our cardiac surgery department.
Preoperative coronary angiography revealed a progression of the coronary artery disease.
Consequently the patient was scheduled for conventional aortic and mitral valve replacement, as well as coronary artery bypass surgery.
The operation was performed via median sternotomy.
On initialization of cardiopulmonary bypass, the ascending aorta was opened for exploration of the aortic valve (Fig.2A).
After careful removal of the CoreValve prosthesis, an Edwards Perimount aortic valve prosthesis (diameter 25 mm) was implanted.
After vein-grafting of the circumflex coronary artery, the mitral valve was explored via the left atrium and excised with the attached clip.
Thereafter, an Edwards Perimount mitral valve prosthesis (diameter 31 mm) was implanted.
More recently, the atrial septal occluder was removed prior to direct closure of the resulting septal defect with a single-suture line (Fig.2B).
Intraoperative echocardiography revealed adequate function of both prostheses and the operation was completed in the usual manner.
During the postoperative phase, the patient recovered well from surgery although hospitalization was prolonged by transient renal failure and recurring pleural effusions.
After a month of postoperative care, the patient was discharged from hospital to rehabilitation in a good condition, without signs for heart failure.
At follow-up three months after surgery, the patient was still in a cardiopulmonary stable condition, undergoing additional physiotherapy.

"A 30-year-old female (65 kg) underwent rhinoplasty under general anaesthesia, which was induced using a combination of a bolus of Remifentanyl (0.5 μg/kg) and Propofol 2 mg/kg.
Muscle paralysis was obtained with Cisatracurium (0.15 μg/kg).
Transoral intubation was performed with a Macintosh blade (No.3) and a size 7 mm diameter reinforced tracheal tube was easily and gently placed in the trachea, on the first attempt and was then fixed to the right corner of the mouth.
No problems were encountered during laryngoscopy and intubation.
The cuff of the tube was inflated with a pressure ≤ 20 cm H2O.
No adjustment of cuff volume was made intra-operatively.
N2O was not used for inhalation anaesthesia.
The throat pack was placed in the pharynx to avoid the passage of blood in the aero-digestive tract.
General anaesthesia was maintained with Sevofluorane in oxygen/air and Remifentanyl in continuous infusion 0.25 μg/kg/min.
Moderate arterial hypotension was maintained with a cuff systolic artery pressure of approximately 90 mmHg.
The operation was carried out in a semi-supine position with the head slightly inclined forward and laterally and trunk slightly elevated.
Duration of the operation was 100 minutes.
The patient was extubated, after removal of the throat pack without problems.
The following day the patient complained of difficulty in swallowing, dysphonia and hoarseness.
Examination revealed deviation of the tongue to the right side and vocal cord paralysis, expression of hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury without local oedema or haematoma.
The movements of the pharynx and soft palate were normal.
Meticulous neurological examination, including also magnetic resonance imaging (MRN) revealed no other evidence of central or cranial nerve involvement.
Conservative management included steroids, vitamins together with speech and swallowing therapy.
Full recovery of lingual and laryngeal functions was obtained within four months after surgery.
"
"A 35-year-old woman presented to the ear, nose and throat outpatient department with headache and a blocked left-sided nasal canal with epistaxis for 2 years.
Medical history revealed secondary amenorrhoea for the past 19 years with regression of secondary sexual characteristics with no galactorrhoea.
Physical and ophthalmological examinations were within normal limits.
Nasal examination revealed a left-sided choanal mass.
As the mass was bleeding on palpation, imaging was advised prior to performing a biopsy.
MRI of the head showed a sellar and infra-sellar mass extending into the nasopharynx (figure 1).
The patient was then referred to the endocrinologist for further hormonal investigation.
Her serum prolactin was very high—7443 µg/L (N<20).
Other pituitary hormones were within normal limits.
A final diagnosis of giant prolactinoma was made and the patient was prescribed cabergoline 0.25 mg twice per week with the associated risks explained in advance.
"
"A 60-year-old man who underwent colonoscopy was found to have a 2 cm sessile polyp that was located 10 cm from the anal verge and successfully removed.
The polyp was a tubulovillous adenoma with focal high-grade dysplasia.
A flexible sigmoidoscopy performed three months later, as well as a repeat colonoscopy one year after the initial colonoscopy, were both negative for recurrence.
A colonoscopy performed three years after the initial colonoscopy revealed a sessile polyp, 3 cm in size, at 10 cm from the anal verge.
Biopsies were taken and reported to be fragments of a villous adenoma with low-grade dysplasia.
Due to the previous high-grade dysplasia, relatively rapid recurrence and concern that a cancer may have been missed by sampling error, a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) were performed before definitive excision.
The MRI revealed an invasive rectal mass involving the muscularis propria but without breach of the adventitia, consistent with a T2 rectal carcinoma (Figure 1).
No pelvic lymphadenopathy was detected.
The EUS revealed a rectal mass involving the mucosa and submucosa, with no involvement of the muscularis propria (Figure 2).
The results of the MRI and EUS, as well as the surgical versus endoscopic resection treatment options, were discussed with the patient, who opted for a surgical resection.
The patient underwent a low anterior resection and end-to-end anastomosis with loop ileostomy.
Pathology review of the resected rectosigmoid revealed a villous adenoma with low-grade dyplasia.
There was no evidence of muscularis propria invasion, and a total of five pericolic and two mesorectal lymph nodes were excised and deemed benign.
The patient underwent ileostomy reversal five months later.
He remains asymptomatic with no recurrence of tumours.
"
"A 24-year-old Azeri male presented with a chief complaint of blurred vision in both eyes.
He was diagnosed with achondroplasia in early childhood.
He was born at term with normal birth weight.
There was no history of hereditary ocular or systemic disease.
This patient had characteristic features of achondroplasia (i.e., short stature, lumbar lordosis, short proximal long bones, large hands, frontal bossing, and flat nasal bridge) [Figure 1].
His height was 108 cm.
Best corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in the right eye with −0.75 + 1.25 × 60° and 20/70 in the left eye with OS: +0.25 + 0.50 × 130°.
Pupils were equal in size, round and reactive to light with no reverse afferent pupillary defect.
Ocular motility was normal in both eyes and slit lamp examination was unremarkable.
The intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg by Goldmann applanation tonometry.
Central corneal thickness values of the right and left eyes were, 561 and 557 μ, respectively.
Dilated fundus examination revealed a well-demarcated circular macular lesion in both eyes.
In the right eye, this lesion was approximately 2.5 disc diameters (DD) in width and 2.7 DD in length.
In the left eye, this lesion was approximately 2.5 DD in width and 2.8 DD in length.
The border of the lesions was pigmented.
Underlying choroidal and overlying retinal vasculature appeared normal.
In addition, a stalk of tissue emanated from the optic disc and coursed into the vitreous [Figure 2].
Fluorescein angiography of the posterior segment and optical coherence tomography of the optic nerve head (Stratus; Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany) were performed [Figures ​[Figures3 and 4].
Due to the background maculopathy, the patient could not appropriately fixate on the target during image acquisition resulting in slightly decentered fluorescein angiography images [Figure 3].

"The patient, a 9 year-old Caucasian female, was first diagnosed with medulloblastoma at age 3 years.
Treatment included surgical resection of the tumor followed by systemic chemotherapy (Vincristine, Lomustine, Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Etoposide), and craniospinal radiation (2,340 cGy) with boost to the posterior fossa (total dose 5,900 cGy).
Cis-RA was subsequently administered for eleven, 14-day cycles (180mg/m2 per day), over a 13-month period for a cumulative dose of 17,360 mg (24,640 mg/m2).
She completed medulloblastoma therapy at age 5.6 years.
At age 6 years, she was diagnosed with radiation-induced central hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency (GHD).
She was treated with levothyroxine with subsequent biochemical euthyroidism.
Given tumor remission status and an abnormal height velocity of 0.94 cm/year, growth hormone (GH) therapy was initiated at age 7 years (0.3 mg/kg/week) with subsequent increased height velocity of 3.6 cm growth/seven months; however, seven months after initiation of GH, increased bony prominence was noted at wrists and knees, concomitant with declining height velocity (1.6 cm growth/five months).
Physical examination and radiographs were significant for leg length discrepancy: the right lower extremity measured 1.75 cm shorter than the left (right femur 24.9 cm, right tibia 19.6 cm, right lower extremity 44.5 cm, left femur 25.25 cm, left tibia 21 cm, and left lower extremity 46.25 cm).
Prior to initiation of GH, height (102 cm) (Figure 1) and armspan (102 cm) were similar, with upper segment/lower segment ratio of one; seven months after GH, height increased minimally (105.6 cm) compared to the more significant increase in armspan (109.2 cm), with upper segment/lower segment ratio remaining at one.
Radiographs revealed poorly visualized growth plates in both distal and proximal femurs and tibias (Figure 2A-B), raising concern for premature closure of the physes.
This lower limb growth plate closure would normally be observed at the time of late-stage puberty.
By contrast, all bone ages using left hand and wrist radiographs over the preceding two years displayed open growth plates (Figure 2C-D).
"
"An 82-year-old male was admitted in our outside hospital’s emergency room due to abdominal pain and faint.
He had a previous history of auricular fibrillation in treatment with a dicumarinic anticoagulant and a previous episode of abdominal pain which was diagnosed as spontaneous mesenchimal haematoma and treated non operatively.
He denied any kind of trauma, and had no hematemesis or melena.
At physical examination the patient was stable and suffered from intense pain at the right lower abdomen with no defense.
Blood tests showed a haemoglobin level of 10 g/dl.
Coagulation was altered as expected.
CT scan showed massive hemoperitoneum (Figure 1) and the already known mesenteric hematoma (Figure 2).
Assuming the diagnosis of expansive mesenteric hematoma plus ongoing bleeding a laparotomy was performed.
During first exploration, 3 liters of fresh and old blood clots were found.
At 90cm from the ileocecal valve a torsionated and perforated meckel diverticulum with intradiverticular bleeding was found (Figure 3) and a diverticular resection was performed.
The postoperatory was uneventful and the patient was discharged home at the 9th postoperative day.
"
"A 76-year-old Japanese man had experienced a decreased appetite, nausea, and abdominal distension since late February 2011.
The patient passed loose, soft stools that were not watery once daily.
The results of blood tests performed by the primary care physician (PCP) between April and June were all normal, but upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy showed atrophic gastritis.
Therefore, we assessed the patient for Helicobacter pylori antibodies and performed the rapid urease test and a histopathological evaluation, all of which were negative.
In June, the patient received medication from a mental health clinic, but because the symptoms did not improve and his body weight further decreased by 23 kg, he stopped the medication; he was referred to our department in November.
The patient had been suffering from hypertension since his 30s.
Amlodipine (5 mg/day) administration was initiated in 2005, and olmesartan from May 2008; the patient is currently receiving 30 mg/day of olmesartan.
He denied the use of any other new medications or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
He had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption.
Physical examination showed that the patient had a height of 165 cm, a body weight of 47 kg, and body mass index of 17 kg/m2.
His body temperature was 36.3℃; pulse rate, 101/min; blood pressure, 101/81 mmHg; respiratory rate, 12 breaths/min; and saturation from pulse oximetry (SpO2) was 98%.
The patient had no heart murmur, third heart sound or jugular venous distension.
The patient had bilateral pitting edema on his lower legs and presented with unilateral gaze-evoked nystagmus as well as a mildly reduced tactile sensation and thermal nociception in the toes and dorsal regions of both feet.
Moreover, the finger-to-nose test results and tandem gait were poor, and his patellar and Achilles tendon reflexes had disappeared.
Confabulation was observed in the patient, and the revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) score was 17/30 (cut-off point: 20).
The hematologic findings were as follows: white blood cell count, 6,200 /μL; hemoglobin level, 12.5 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 88.4; platelet count, 230,000 /μL; sodium level, 136 mEq/L; potassium level, 3.8 mEq/L; chlorine level, 103 mEq/L; iron level, 57 μg/dL (reference value: 64-187 μg/dL); ferritin level, 366 ng/mL (reference value: 50-200 ng/mL); B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, 125.3 pg/mL (reference value: -18.4 pg/mL); and vitamin B1 level, 8 ng/mL (reference value: 24-66 ng/mL).
An electrocardiogram was normal and chest X-rays showed a normal cardiothoracic ratio (40.8%) without either pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion.
Cranial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-magnetic resonance imaging findings revealed periaqueductal hyperintensities (Fig.1); therefore, Wernicke encephalopathy was diagnosed.
Moreover, as sinus tachycardia and a tendency towards hypotension were noted, no clear symptoms of heart failure or dehydration were observed; it was thus inferred that the vitamin B1 deficiency had likely played a role in both of the conditions.
The antihypertensive agents were discontinued, and 10 days after the intravenous administration of vitamin B1, the patient's loss of appetite, nausea, and gait disturbance disappeared, and his body weight increased by 3 kg.
Nystagmus was ameliorated on physical examination, but the patient still had confabulations, and the HDS-R score and absence of deep tendon reflexes did not improve.
Since the gastrointestinal symptoms were ameliorated and his blood pressure increased to 160/90 mmHg, the PCP resumed the administration of olmesartan on late December, 2011.
One week later, the patient complained of recurrent decreased appetite and nausea.
After experiencing diarrhea (five bowel movements during a 2-day period), he passed soft stools once daily, and his body weight decreased to 47 kg so he came to our hospital again 3 weeks after the resumption of olmesartan for treatment.
His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 35.1℃; pulse rate, 93/min; and blood pressure, 132/75 mmHg.
The neurologic findings showed no worsening of his symptoms.
The laboratory findings were as follows: sodium level, 139 mEq/L; potassium level, 2.9 mEq/L; and chlorine level, 116 mEq/L.
Hyperchloremia was noted, and the serum sodium level minus chloride level (139-116) was 23 mEq/L; additionally, the arterial blood gas findings were as follows: pH, 7.25; PCO2, 25 mmHg, and HCO3, 11 mmol/L.
The urinalysis findings were as follows: sodium level, 15 mEq/L; potassium level, 13 mEq/L; chlorine level, 100 mEq/L; and urine anion gap, -72 mEq/L, and there was no apparent increase in bowel movements; however, this seemed to be due to the absence of HCO3- from the gastrointestinal tract (6).
Plain abdominal radiography and abdominal computed tomography findings revealed the continuous dilation of the entire intestinal tract (Fig.2); therefore, the patient was diagnosed with intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
After discontinuing olmesartan, the nausea and body weight decreases were promptly ameliorated.
Duodenal biopsy findings after discontinuing olmesartan showed that the inflammation observed before discontinuation as well as the fold structure had both clearly ameliorated (Fig.3).

"Our patient was a 7-year-old Italian boy born after an uneventful gestation of normal duration.
At the age of 16 months, he presented with a clinically evident enlarged abdomen and was referred for oncological examination.
Initial tests revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly.
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the presence of foam cells, which led to suspicion of lysosomal storage disease.
Biochemical testing revealed elevated level of acid phosphatase (47.8 IU/L [normal range 5–7 IU/L]) and chitotriosidase activity (508 nmol/mg protein [normal range 5.9–41.0 nmol/mg protein]), as well as reduced beta-glucosidase activity (2 nmol/mg/protein [normal range 4.5–18.0 nmol/mg/protein]).
Molecular analysis showed homozygous L444P mutations in the GBA gene (OMIM reference 606463), confirming the diagnosis of chronic NGD.
The patient began ERT at a dosage of 60 U/kg every 2 weeks at the age of 18 months.
Thereafter, when the patient reached the age of 30 months, we decided to combine ERT with SRT with miglustat.
This clinical decision was approved by our institution’s ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents before commencing combination therapy.
The dose of miglustat was adjusted according to the patient’s body surface area and was uptitrated during the first 4 weeks with the following scheme: one-third of target dose during weeks 1 and 2, two-thirds of target dose during weeks 3 and 4, and target dose (100 mg three times daily) after 1 month.
From 2 weeks before starting miglustat therapy, the patient also followed specific dietary modifications, avoiding high intake of carbohydrate-containing food in single meals, especially foods high in disaccharides, such as sucrose and maltose, to ensure acceptable gastrointestinal tolerability.
He experienced mild episodes of diarrhea after commencing miglustat therapy, which decreased in frequency/severity over time.
From the start of ERT/miglustat combination treatment, we observed a reduction in splenomegaly and a gradual normalization of hematological values and plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (Table 1).
Plasma chitotriosidase was evaluated at the time of diagnosis and then approximately every 6 months during follow-up.
Values showed an initial reduction after the start of ERT, with a further, substantial, and sustained decrease after commencement of miglustat treatment (Fig.1).
The patient has been followed according to recommended guidelines for GD, which specify a complete neurological examination, clinical evaluation of ocular movements, and psychological evaluations every 6–12 months [10].
After 5 years of combination therapy and follow-up, the patient did not show any signs of neurological impairment.
As of February 2016, he had not displayed any epileptic crises and had demonstrated clinical performance and cooperation.
He showed good muscular tone and trophism, normal reflexes with a slight hyperreflexia in his legs, and a negative Romberg sign.
His toe and heel deambulation was normal.
In particular, ocular evaluations revealed no evidence of saccadic movement velocity reduction and normal visual evoked potentials.
The patient’s auditory brain responses were also normal.
In addition, he has not demonstrated any cognitive impairment, and he has regularly attended school with good performance since the age of 5 years.

"A woman in her early 70s presented to our emergency room 30 min after her husband expired with 8/10, substernal chest pain with concurrent diaphoresis and dyspnoea.
The patient's husband had an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest earlier that day and was brought to our emergency room and subsequently admitted to the coronary care unit.
He had recurrent ventricular fibrillation and could not be successfully resuscitated.
The patient's medical history included hypertension and hypothyroidism.
She denied having had a similar episode of pain.
She had regular appointments with her primary care physician.
Her medication included oral furosemide 20 mg and levothyroxine 100 µg, both once daily.
She denied allergies.
On presentation, the patient was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 105/55, heart rate of 93 bpm, respiratory rate of 20/min and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.
On physical examination, she was in significant distress due to pain.
Her skin was warm and moist, with minimal crackles in bilateral bases, regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur of the apex without radiation, no rubs, elevated jugular vein distention of 8 cm, strong peripheral pulses and no peripheral oedema.
The abdomen was soft, non-tender, non-distended, with bowel sounds, and the patient was alert and oriented without focal neurological deficits.
The complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and coagulation tests were within normal limits.
The cardiac enzymes were increased with a troponin I of 2.59 ng/mL (normal range 0.015–0.045 ng/mL), creatine phosphokinase of 84 U/L (normal range 26–192 U/L).
ECG on admission revealed normal sinus rhythm with 2–3 mm ST segment elevations in leads V2–V3 and Q waves in leads V1–V3, suggestive of anterior wall infarct (figure 2).
An echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction of 30–35% with mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, akinesis of the apex and 2/3 of the inferoseptum and apical inferior-anterior wall segments, suggesting ischaemic damage at the left anterior descending artery distribution versus takotsubo cardiomyopathy (figures 3 and ​4).
The patient received aspirin 162 mg and prasugrel 60 mg, and was taken to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory.
The angiogram showed non-obstructive coronary artery disease with luminal irregularities (figures 5 and ​6).
The left ventriculography showed an ejection fraction of 35% with akinesis of apical wall and hyperkinesis of basal segments (figures 7 and 8).
The patient remained haemodynamically stable and was started on oral heart failure medications, including lisinopril 2.5 mg daily and metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg two times a day.
Her pain and shortness of breath resolved and she was discharged home after 48 h of hospitalisation in stable condition.
A repeat echocardiogram 2 months later showed resolution of her cardiomyopathy and an ejection fraction of 65–70%, with normal left ventricular motion.

"A newborn boy of healthy nonconsanguineous parents was delivered at 37 weeks’ gestation by cesarean section.
His mother (primipara, 32 years old) had been admitted to our hospital 2 weeks previously because of reduced fetal intrauterine movements and polyhydramnios.
The child’s birthweight was 2,330 g (<10th percentile), length 47 cm, and head circumference 33.2 cm (25th percentile).
He had low-set ears and bilateral clubfoot.
Apgar scores were 2, 6, and 7 at 1, 5, and 10 minutes.
The child presented with severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, requiring ventilatory assistance and total parenteral nutrition.
Weaning failed because of inadequate pulmonary ventilation and respiratory acidosis.
Hearing loss was detected by auditory evoked potentials, while cranial MRI showed mildly enlarged ventricles and liquor spaces.
Two days after birth, the infant presented with severe abdominal distension with a hypoactive bowel.
MRI revealed marked intestinal dilation without mechanical obstruction.
Laboratory investigations showed hypoglycemia (27 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (0.58 mmol/L), and hypokalemia (2.4 mmol/L).
Blood lactate was normal (1.3 mmol/L, normal range 0.5–2.2 mmol/L) and liver enzymes were unremarkable.
A skeletal muscle biopsy was performed and showed scattered, hypertrophic cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient and succinate dehydrogenase–positive muscle fibers (figure), suggesting a mitochondrial disorder.
Molecular genetic studies revealed marked mtDNA depletion in muscle (93% decrease as compared to age-matched controls), while a screen for mtDNA rearrangements within individual COX-positive and COX-deficient fibers4 was negative.
We sequenced the entire coding region and intron-exon boundaries of the POLG1 gene, identifying two reported heterozygous missense mutations in compound c.679C>T predicting p.R227W and c.2542G>A predicting p.G848S.
Sequencing of parental samples confirmed recessive inheritance.
The infant died at 20 days of respiratory failure.
At autopsy, the brain did not show remarkable changes on gross examination.
Histology was not informative due to poor preservation of tissue; there was no evidence of neuronal damage in the spinal cord.
The liver showed diffuse cholestasis, consistent with total parenteral nutrition; hepatocyte steatosis, necrosis, or liver fibrosis were not observed.
The testicles were undescended, while remaining visceral organs were normal except for a marked dilation and thinning of the bowel wall.
Despite normal histology, analysis of stomach, ileum, and colon homogenates revealed severe mtDNA depletion (up to 94% decrease; table e-1 on the Neurology® Web site at www.neurology.org).
Laser capture microdissection analysis5 revealed that the mtDNA depletion was confined to the muscularis propria, being most prominent in its external layer (figure).
Ganglion cells from the myenteric plexus showed milder mtDNA depletion, restricted to the small intestine (figure).
There was no mtDNA depletion in liver (not shown).

"The affected individual, a male, was the fourth child born to an Arab Muslim family of Palestinian origin.
Parents are first cousins.
One sibling, a girl died at the age of 1 month due to SIDS according to parents, without any investigation.
Informed consent for muscle, skin biopsy and exome sequencing was obtained from the parents, and the study was approved by the local institutional review board.
During pregnancy, the patient was suspected to have IUGR and was delivered by Cesarian section at 36+2 gestational weeks with Apgar scores 9 and 10.
Birth weight was 2.3 kg (10th percentile) and head circumference 32 cm (10th percentile).
Physical exam after birth, detected a systolic murmur 3/6.
On the first day of life, the patient developed metabolic acidosis with lactate level of 27 mm (normal range 0.5–2.4 mm) and elevated ammonia levels 277 μm (normal range 10–60 μm).
Metabolic work up showed normal acylcarnitines, elevated alanine level 1400 μm (normal <700 μm), and urine organic acids showed increased lactic acidosis and ketones.
Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly, and cardiac Echo revealed symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy tricuspid regurge and pulmonary hypertension.
The patient was transported to the NICU and treated with bicarbonate, acetate and diuretics.
At the age of 4 days, quadriceps muscle biopsy was performed.
Pathology showed decreased cytochrome c oxidase stain.
Brain ultrasound performed at age 5 days was normal.
Subsequently, head circumference grew rapidly adding 13 centimeters by age 35 days, repeated brain US revealed dilated ventricles confirmed by head CT, which also showed subcortical and white matter cortical hemorrhage in the occipital region.
At 15 weeks, a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt was inserted.
Head CT performed at age 2 years showed prominent dilatation of the ventricles (Figure 1).
Due to hypotonia with feeding difficulties and recurrent aspirations, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube was inserted at age 10 weeks.
Eye examination at the age of 15 weeks revealed cortical blindness.
Hearing test ABR was normal.
Repeated cardiac Echo continued to show mild tricuspid regurge, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in the first months of life.
At the age of 4 months, he started developing hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, he was started on diuretics and beta blockers and later calcium channel blockers were added; follow-up Echo at the age of 2 years revealed improvement in the LVH and no PHTN.
Coenzyme Q10 supplementation (60 mg twice daily) was initiated at 4 months but discontinued by the parents.
In the following months, the patient was admitted several times to the hospital mainly due to chest infections, shunt malfunctioning and fevers.
He died at the age of 30 months due to severe hypoxemia after a febrile illness with chest infection and pulmonary edema; parents refused mechanical ventilation and refused reanimation.

"A 73-year-old man who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at 35 year of age, who had severe diabetic neuropathy and diabetic-ESRD complained of respiratory distress and sudden chest pain.
On the first day of treatment, he visited the emergency room.
A physical examination revealed that his body temperature was 35.4°C, his heart rate was 90 beats/min with a regular rhythm; and his blood pressure was 130/77 mmHg.
A physical examination revealed coarse crackles on bilateral lung auscultation.
The laboratory data showed a WBC count of 8,800/μL with a shift to the left (neutrophils 82%), Hb 10.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 82.2 mg/dL, creatinine (Cre) 6.50 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.9%, creatine kinase (CK) 189 IU/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) 8.51 mg/dL, brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) 127.4 pg/mL.
A chest radiograph revealed perihilar consolidations and air bronchograms (Fig.1).
An electrocardiogram revealed ST-segment elevation and poor R-wave progression in leads V1-V3, and echocardiography revealed apical and ventricular asynergy.
The patient was therefore diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.
Coronary angiography was performed, revealing severe angiostenosis in the septal branch.
PCI was therefore performed.
The patient required continuous maintenance dialysis.
On the following day, the patient went into cardiorespiratory arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, followed by mechanical ventilation.
On day 8, ventilator assistance was discontinued.
However, the patient produced an increasing volume of sputum, which began to appear purulent.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was identified from a sputum culture, and tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC) (4.5g q12h) was administered.
Despite this therapy, the patient's respiratory condition worsened and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan on day 15 revealed bilateral perihilar opacities, pleural effusion, and atelectasis.(Fig.2).
We suspected the development of complications such as microbial substitution, pneumomycosis and thus performed sputum culturing and serum fungal antigen tests.
The administration of TAZ/PIPC was changed to meropenem (0.5 g/day).
On day 16, the patient's serum tested positive for Cryptococcus antigen.
On day 21, cryptococcal bodies were identified in two sets of blood cultures and liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) (3 mg/kg/day) was administered.
On day 23, cryptococcal bodies were identified in the sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, and bilateral pleural effusion (Fig.3).
The patient was therefore diagnosed with disseminated cryptococcosis.
On day 25, brain CT revealed the absence of intracranial hypertension and a brain abscess.
The patient was not infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The administration of L-AMB (3 mg/kg/day) was continued.
On day 31, chest CT revealed a solitary nodule in the left lingular segment for the first time, which was suspected to be a pulmonary cryptococcus lesion (Fig.4a).
After several days, all of the sputum, blood, bilateral pleural effusion, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures tested negative.
On day 52, chest CT revealed another lung nodule in the right pulmonary apical region.
These nodules gradually decreased in size until day 79 (Fig.4b and c).
Although L-AMB was considered effective, the C-reactive protein level remained elevated and the bilateral pleural effusion continuously increased.
The patient lost consciousness because of decreased vital capacity with increasing bilateral pleural effusion and was diagnosed with CO2 narcosis.
The patient's general condition deteriorated.
On day 87, ventricular fibrillation occurred and the patient died.
Autopsy was not performed.
At a later date, the Cryptococcus isolate was identified and classified as Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii (serotype A) by a genetic analysis.

"A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of hypertension was admitted to our hospital with a recent diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma.
Her lactate dehydrogenase level was high and the diameter of her mediastinal mass was more than 10cm.
Her physical examination was normal, and basal electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 72 beats/minute.
Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE; Siemens, Acuson Sequoia, C512) revealed normal biventricular functions with an LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 60%, mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pericardial effusion.
A risk assessment of the patient put her into a high-risk category and she underwent rituximab-hyperfractionated-cyclophosphamide-vincristine-doxorubicin-dexamethasone (R-Hyper-CVAD) chemotherapy protocol.
Her laboratory values are summarized in Table 1.
She received high-dose cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 twice daily for 3 days, doxorubicin 25mg/m2/day for 2 days, rituximab 375mg/m2/day for 1 day, dexamethasone 40mg/day for 4 days, and vincristine 2mg/day for 2 days.
The total treatment dose of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin received was 1800mg/m2 and 50mg/m2, respectively.
She was given allopurinol 300mg/day perorally, sodium bicarbonate (8.4%, 10 flacon/day) infusion for 24 hours before chemotherapy, and mesna 600mg/m2/day for 2 days as prophylaxis against tumor lysis syndrome and hemorrhagic cystitis, respectively.
She also received granisetron 2mg/day and lansoprazole 30mg/day as antiemetogenic and gastric prophylaxis, respectively.
The patient developed dyspnea on the seventh day of therapy.
A physical examination revealed blood pressure of 100/60mmHg and a heart rate of 110 beats/minute.
On chest auscultation, no inspiratory sounds were heard at lower zones and inspiratory crackles were heard at middle zones.
Neither cardiac murmurs nor S3 were heard.
An ECG showed low voltage in the limb and precordial leads.
TTE showed diffusely increased myocardial echogenicity, mild pericardial effusion, and generally impaired biventricular systolic functions with an LVEF 31% and right ventricular mid-apical akinesis.
Manifest pleural effusion was also detected.
Drug-induced cardiotoxicity (myocarditis) was suspected.
Furosemide and ramipril were started.
The beta-blocker therapy the patient was already taking for hypertension was continued.
After 12 days, TTE showed an LVEF of 37% and normal right ventricular functions.
Her dyspnea decreased and she was discharged on day 20.
After 1 month, TTE showed normal biventricular functions with an LVEF of 60%.
After the first course of the R-Hyper-CVAD chemotherapy protocol, she underwent a high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine cycle.
She had severe neutropenia and pneumonia.
She had no cardiac failure symptoms during this chemotherapy course, but she declined another course of chemotherapy.
She is still in remission despite the abbreviated course of chemotherapy.

"This case report was approved by the Review Board of Shandong Power Central Hospital and the patient's parents signed informed consent for publication of the case report and any accompanying images.
A 4-year-old female child presented at the outpatients department with slowly enlarging, painless, symmetrical swelling of both cheeks.
When the girl was approximately 2 years old, the parents noticed a change in her facial symmetry, which later became more obvious.
On palpation, the swellings were bony and hard in consistency.
The skin over the swelling was smooth and freely movable, with no increase in temperature (Fig.1).
There was no history of any trauma, pain, pus discharge, blood discharge, fever, paresthesia, anorexia, or weight loss.
No significant family history was reported.
Panoramic radiography revealed involvement of both the mandible and the maxilla, and showed a soap bubble-like multilocular radiolucency with thin and expanded cortices.
Unerupted teeth included: 15, 25, 35, 37, 45, and 47 was impacted (Fig.2).
Multislice computed tomography showed the presence of multilocular cystic lesions filled with soft-tissue density material and dental anomalies affecting the body and the sides of the mandible.
Similar lesions were also observed in the maxilla (Fig.3).
A biopsy was obtained from the central area of the left rami.
Histologic examination showed many large multinucleated giant cells in a loose, delicate fibrillar connective tissue stroma containing large numbers of fibroblasts and many small blood vessels (Fig.4).
As the child grows older, the lesions often become static and may show regression at puberty.
In the current case, no surgical intervention was under taken and the patient was followed up at regular intervals.
"
"A 71-year-old woman with known diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) presented to the ER with exacerbation of CHF and a decreased level of consciousness.
Brachial blood pressure (BP) was measured at 55/40 mmHg.
The patient had four recent admissions with exacerbation of CHF.
Her medical history was also significant for autoimmune hepatitis, but preserved liver function; esophageal varices with a bleeding episode; and long-term corticosteroid therapy complicated by adrenal insufficiency, type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis.
Recent echocardiography had revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
Cardiac catheterization in a recent admission demonstrated 50% stenosis in the second diagonal artery, with mild diffuse disease in the other coronary arteries.
Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy had ruled out myocarditis and infiltrative cardiomyopathies, but healing ischemic microinfarcts with atheroemboli were observed.
Previous BP values were also low; systolic BP was between 60 mmHg and 65 mmHg, and diastolic BP was between 40 mmHg and 45 mmHg.
Following intubation, dopamine was started for hypotension management and was later replaced with noradrenaline.
The patient developed atrial flutter but successfully converted to sinus rhythm with two direct current electric shocks.
Cardiology consultation resulted in admission to the coronary care unit (CCU).
On admission to the CCU, BP was measured at 56/36 mmHg in the left arm but was not detectable in the right arm.
An arterial line was inserted via the femoral artery, and BP was measured at 191/92 mmHg.
BP values were consistently much higher through the femoral arterial line than the cuff on the arms, and was higher in the left arm than in the right arm.
For instance, on the first day post-CCU admission, BP at one point was measured at 170/80 mmHg through the arterial line, while cuff readings on the arms were 83/74 mmHg on the left and 60/39 mmHg on the right arm.
To investigate the inconsistency between brachial and femoral BP values, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax was obtained using 1.25 mm slices, both before and after intravenous contrast injection with sagittal and coronal planar reformatting of maximum-intensity projection images.
Analysis of the initial unenhanced CT images showed densely calcified plaque or thrombus at the origins of both subclavian arteries and the right common carotid artery.
The CT angiogram showed absence of flow in the right subclavian artery, a very tight stenosis at the origin of the left subclavian artery and a tight stenosis at the origin of the right common carotid artery.
Both vertebral arteries showed normal calibre and flow (Figure 1).
Further management following the insertion of the femoral arterial line was based on femoral BP readings with diuretics and BP-lowering agents.
The patient was eventually discharged in stable condition.
She remained stable during the eight months between discharge and the time the present report was written, without further exacerbation of CHF or related ER visits.
"
"A 73-year-old Hispanic male with a history of stage IV chronic kidney disease and three-vessel coronary artery disease was admitted for coronary artery bypass graft surgery and mitral valve repair.
On post-operative day two, the patient developed cardiac tamponade and subsequently progressed to a cardiac arrest while temporary pacing wires were being removed.
Advanced cardiovascular life support and emergent exploratory sternotomy were performed, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further care.
During the patient’s ICU admission, his renal failure progressed, requiring hemodialysis.
A nasogastric tube was placed on post-operative day two for establishing early enteral nutrition.
PEG tube insertion was suggested given his cognitive impairment and poor swallowing function on the Modified Barium Swallow test.
His coagulation profile prior to the procedure revealed an international normalized ratio of 1.04 and partial thromboplastin time of 36 seconds.
A complete blood count showed a hemoglobin of 11.6 grams per deciliter, a hematocrit of 34.9%, and 281×103 platelets per microliter.
His blood urea nitrogen was 55 milligrams/deciliter, and his serum creatinine was 5.22 milligrams/deciliter.
The patient was taking aspirin 81 mg per day due to recent cardiac surgery, but was not on any anticoagulant agents.
He also did not have a history of coagulopathy.
PEG tube insertion was performed on post-operative day eight under intravenous anesthesia.
The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was accomplished without difficulty, revealing diffuse moderately erythematous mucosa without bleeding in the gastric antrum.
While attempting PEG tube placement, a rapidly expanding hematoma (Figure 1) developed at the needle insertion site.
The procedure was stopped and the patient was sent back to the ICU with a nasogastric tube.
A single dose of intravenous desmopressin (0.3 microgram/kilogram) was administered under the suspicion of uremic bleeding.
No further gastrointestinal bleeding events were noted.
To assess platelet function, a platelet function assay (PFA) was ordered after desmopressin injection.
PFA collagen/epinephrine closure time was 195 seconds (normal <174 seconds), and collagen/ADP closure time was 76 seconds (normal <120 seconds), indicating platelet dysfunction due to either aspirin or uremia.
Aspirin was discontinued, and he was monitored with a daily complete blood count and metabolic panel.
Three days later the patient underwent a second attempt at PEG tube placement.
PFA collagen/epinephrine closure time prior to this procedure had gone down to 141 seconds, possibly due to withholding aspirin and an improvement in renal function.
EGD showed an area of flat, bluish gastric submucosal bruising at the site of the previous hematoma (Figure 2).
The PEG tube was placed successfully at an adjacent site.
Over the course of the following month, the patient continued to undergo feeding through the PEG tube with no adverse events.
"
"An 18-year-old male was diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 2005.
He was overweight with a body mass index (BMI) of 40.
He was started on quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel®) 900 mg daily in April 2005 and methylphenidate (Concerta®) 54 mg daily in September 2005.
In the beginning of August 2006 he was admitted to his local hospital with severe dyspnoea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and cyanosis.
On admission the blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg, and the arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.45, pCO2 of 3.55 kPa, paO2 of 7.76 kPa, and BE of −5.1 mmol/l.
C-reactive protein was not elevated.
The chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart.
He developed hemoptysis and was treated with unfractionated heparin in suspicion of pulmonary embolism.
He subsequently developed cardiogenic shock and was treated with vasoactive drugs.
In spite of the treatment he became oliguric and his liver enzymes were rising.
He was referred to our hospital for further treatment.
On admission the blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, despite infusion with noradrenaline.
His heart rate was 130/minute and his temperature was 38.4 °C.
A thoracic computed tomography scan did not show pulmonary embolism.
Echocardiography revealed biventricular failure and left ventricular end diastolic diameter was 7 cm.
The left ventricle was severely hypokinetic with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%–25%.
The left ventricular end diastolic pressure was markedly elevated, and there was a moderate mitral regurgitation.
Intermittent hemodialysis was initiated.
His liver function improved slightly, but despite dialysis the renal function deteriorated with increasing creatinine values.
After three days there was a further worsening of the left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 10%–12% and marked pulmonary hypertension with systolic pulmonary pressure estimated to 30 mmHg.
The clinical picture resembled dilated cardiomyopathy with low output failure causing renal and liver failure.
We suspected drug-induced cardiomyopathy and methylphenidate and quetiapine fumarate were discontinued.
Screening for infectious pathogens, immunological markers, and iron or amyloid deposition were all negative.
After three days he was transferred to the National Hospital (Rikshospitalet, Oslo) with ongoing noradrenaline and dobutamine infusions.
Shortly after admission an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted and noradrenaline was replaced by nitroprusside.
Coronary angiography was normal.
Endomyocardial biopsy from the right ventricle did not reveal any distinct myocardial pathology.
On treatment with IABP, nitroprusside, and dialysis, the clinical situation gradually improved and the liver function returned to normal.
His renal function also improved with increasing diuresis and creatinine fell from 798 to 98 μmol/l.
His EF was still markedly reduced (15%).
Because of behavioral problems and adipose stature, he was denied a heart transplant.
He was treated with IABP for 26 days, and after 28 days he was transferred back to our hospital.
At that time his liver and renal functions were normal.
He was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, a beta-blocker, and diuretics.
During the following two weeks his clinical status improved and he was subsequently discharged to his home.
The echocardiography still showed markedly dilated left ventricle with EF of 20%.
In March 2007, his clinical status was improved and he was in function class II (New York Heart Association) with an EF estimated by echocardiography to 30%–35%.
"
"A 21-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion and dry cough.
At physical examination, auscultation of the lungs has revealed random wheezes and coarse crackles.
Cardiac auscultation was normal, and no cyanosis or peripheral edema was observed.
There was no history of smoking or previous known pulmonary disease.
On routine blood examination, blood counts and serum chemistries were found to be normal.
Arterial blood gas analysis and echocardiography showed no important abnormalities.
Pulmonary function tests (PFT) showed a mild restrictive ventilatory defect, with a reduced total lung capacity of 79% (5.94 L), forced vital capacity of 80% (4.18 L) and a forced expiratory volume in one second of 83% (3.72 L).
The sputum was negative for acid-alcohol resistant bacillus and human immunodeficiency virus testing was negative as well.
The chest plain films revealed a diffuse symmetric dense bilateral micronodular pattern (Figure 1).
Based on this finding, HRCT scan was obtained, revealing diffuse ground glass attenuation and septal thickening, more pronounced in lower pulmonary regions, with calcifications along the interlobar septa and subpleural regions.
Subpleural cysts were also noticed (Figure 2).
The patient underwent a fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy.
The lavage fluid was negative for tuberculosis or fungi.
Microliths were not found.
Histology revealed round, concentrically laminated microliths in the alveoli associated with slightly thickened interstitial septa, consistent with the diagnosis of PAM.
"
"A 48 year-old female presented with vaginal bleeding and abnormal Pap smears.
Upon diagnosis of invasive non-keratinizing SCC of the cervix, she underwent a radical hysterectomy with salpingo-oophorectomy which demonstrated positive spread to the pelvic lymph nodes and the parametrium.
Pathological examination revealed that the tumour also extensively involved the lower uterine segment.
5 months after this surgery, the woman underwent external beam radiotherapy and intracavitary brachytherapy.
Two years later, the patient presented with a three-month history of a productive cough, shortness of breath, and a 2-3 week history of progressive exertional dyspnea.
X-rays of the chest demonstrated a reticular nodular pattern, and CT scans revealed multiple bilateral patchy areas of ground glass opacity scarring with focal areas of subsegmental atelectasis within both lungs.
A differential diagnosis included interstitial pneumonia versus non-cardiogenic edema.
The woman underwent a bronchoscopy, left thoracoscopy, and an open wedge left lung biopsy.
Pathological examination of the left lung biopsy confirmed the presence of neoplastic sheets of cells classically distributed along the septal vessels, perivascular, peribronchial, and subpleural lymphatics.
Subpleural nodules were also identified with the presence of neoplastic cells distending the subpleural lymphatics confirming LC (Figures 1A, 1B, 1C).
On immunohistochemical analysis, the lesional cells were strongly positive to p16 (Figure 1D), high and low molecular weight keratins (Figure 1E), cytokeratin-7 (CK7) (Figure 1F), CK19, and pan keratin, and negative to CK20, p63, and EGFR.
Based on these findings, she was diagnosed to have lymphangitic carcinomatosis in the lung metastatic from SCC of the cervix.
She was started on chemotherapy (Carbo/Taxol) with corticosteroids while in the hospital, and was discharged ten days later.
Post-treatment improvement of clinical symptoms was paralleled by radiographic imaging that showed marked interval improvement of the nodular opacifications and the interstitial thickening that had previously been noted.
Despite this improvement, she subsequently died 13 months after the initial diagnosis.
"
"A 58-year-old man with a past medical history of poorly controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes, presented to the ICU for a cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction.
Physical examination revealed reduced level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale 10/15) and weak vital signs; a blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg, 80% of oxygen saturation, capillary blood glucose at 2.26 g/L, a heart rate over 125 bpm, and crackling in pulmonary auscultation.
Cardiovascular examination showed neither cardiac murmur nor signs of right heart failure.
ECG on admission showed normal sinus rhythm, with heart rate of 125 bpm and extended ST-elevation in anterior territory.
Laboratory results demonstrated Troponin I level of 6.41 ng/ml, creatinine kinase (CKMB) was 67 UI/L, Lactate deshydrogenase was 281 UI/L, glucose level 2.70 g/l, urea 0.40 g/l and creatinine 18.6 mg / L.
The patient was intubated and sedated, inotropic agents were started (norepinephrine 0.4µg/kg/min and dobutamine 20µg/kg/min).
Chest X-rays showed diffuse alveolar syndrome.
Transthoracic echocardiography revealed wall motion abnormalities namely extensive akinesis of anteroseptal, anterior, lateral and inferior walls, and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction of 29%).
Medical management was initiated; anticoagulant therapy for acute coronary syndrome was started (500 mg of acetylsalicylic acid and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (0.6ml of enoxaparin)) and patient was prepared for myocardial revascularization by coronary angioplasty.
Because of non-improvement of neurological status and occurrence of seizures, a brain CT was indicated and revealed infratentorial diffuse hemorrhage (Fisher grade III) (Figure 1).
Cerebral angiography confirmed a dissecting aneurysm of an anastomotic branch between left PICA and the V4 segment of left vertebral artery Figure 2 that was successfully embolized.
After 24 hours, the patient improved with withdrawal of vasoactive drugs in 24 hours.
Left hemicorporeal seizures persisted despite anticonvulsant treatment.
Control brain CT did not report rebleeding and angiography showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm while the EEG revealed a diffuse brain damage.
10 days after admission, the patient was discharged in stable condition but still suffers from amnesia.
"
"A 62-year-old female presented to the outpatient department of Wuhan Central Hospital of Tongji Medical College in September 2015with a complaint of recurrent infections in the umbilical region.
She reported abdominal pain similar to a burning sensation that accompanied the discharge of faecal matter.
These symptoms and signs waxed and waned but lasted for 5years.
Our attention was piqued by the fact that the patient’s family described the patient as an individual who cried easily.
The patient had no history of diarrhoea, constipation or other abdominal disturbances.
No surgical treatment was mentioned in her prior medical history.
Acoordinated physical examination revealed normal vital signs.
An external fistula was located in the umbilical region with redness of the surrounding skin.
Morphological examination indicated that fistula secretions mainly consisted of small intestinal juice.
The abdominal wall was soft, with no tenderness.
Bowel sounds were regular.
Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis were detected in the fistula secretion culture.
Other findings from laboratory examinations were normal.
A CT scan of the abdomen revealed that part of the intestinal wall was adhered to the abdominal wall in the navel region, although no bowel obstruction was detected (Fig.1).
A presumptive diagnosis of ECF was reached; this diagnosis was mainly based on digital radiography of the fistulous tract conducted using iopamidol-370 as a contrast agent.
This procedure was performed under local anaesthesia and revealed that the distal ileum approximately 40 cm from the ileocaecal junction was entrapped (Fig.2).
The patient agreed to surgery after a clear preoperative conversation.
She understood the operative risk factors and signed an informed consent.
After bowel preparation, the patient received an exploratory laparotomy.
The abdominal cavity was completely exposed, and a loop of the terminal ileum (approximately 40 cm proximal to the ileocaecal junction) was found entrapped in the internal hernia ring; this finding was consistent with the preoperative contrast image.
The defect in the abdominal wall was less than 1.0 cm, and an extremely small portion of the bowel wall was stuck and could not be retrieved back into the cavity (Fig.3).
Nonetheless, this defect resulted in perforation over the loop (Fig.4).
Side-to-side ileo-ileal anastomosis was completed by utilizing a 75 mm linear stapler to remove the affected ileum segment.
The internal hernia ring was closed with plication sutures instead of via mesh repair due to the patient’s small defect and infection risk.
The abdominal cavity was thoroughly cleaned with saline solution, and a rubber drainage tube was placed in the pelvis.
The scar tissue was removed to improve wound healing; subsequently, relaxation sutures were available to close the abdomen in layers.
A final diagnosis of Richter’s hernia presenting as spontaneous ECF was reached.
The patient was discharged 2 weeks after surgery without serious complications.
No hernia recurrence was observed during 10 months of follow-up.
"
"We report the case of a previously healthy 28-year-old woman, Afro-Brazilian, in her first pregnancy.
Our patient had no medical records until the 36th pregnancy week and reported allergy to diclofenac.
She presented to our emergency department with an acute onset of abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea and vomiting, with no signs of encephalopathy.
Her arterial blood pressure was 110/60mmHg, heart rate was 98bpm, axillary temperature was 35°C, she was severely dehydrated and with decreased peripheral perfusion.
The laboratory examinations revealed hemoglobin 12.3g/dL, leukocytes 13 × 109/mL, platelets 97 × 103/mm3, international nationalized ratio (INR) 6.9, fibrinogen 98mg/dL, total bilirubin 14.2mg/dL, serum creatinine 3.4mg/dL, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 306U/L, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALP) 302U/L, arterial bicarbonate 11mEq/L, arterial pH 7.21, blood glucose 65mg/dL and ionic calcium 1.02mmol/L.
An abdominal ultrasound depicted fatty infiltration of the liver and confirmed fetal viability.
Our patient received an initial fluid load with crystalloids.
The calcium, glucose and hypothermia were reversed.
The diagnosis of AFLP was confirmed following the Swansea’s criteria [9].
Therefore, a cesarean section was indicated.
A thromboelastometry (ROTEM®, Pentapharm Co., Munich, Germany) was performed at the beginning of the surgery.
The thromboelastometry analysis showed an intense kinetic and structural hypocoagulable state (Fig.1 and Table 1).
The FIBTEM revealed an impairment in fibrinogen function quality while the EXTEM depicted a coagulation factor deficiency (Fig.1a-c and Table 1).
Based on, respectively, FIBTEM maximum clot firmness (MCF) (0mm; Table 1) and EXTEM clotting time (CT) (228s; Table 1), 4.0g of fibrinogen concentrate (Haemocomplettan® P, CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) and 1000UI of prothrombin complex concentrate (Beriplex® P/N 500UI, CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) were administered at the beginning of the cesarean section.
The fluid input (crystalloids) and output during the caesarian section were, respectively, 2000mL and 200mL.
The cesarean section succeeded with no major bleeding after the hemostatic therapy.
Additional hemocomponent transfusion, such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate, platelets or blood concentrates, was not necessary.
A second thromboelastometry analysis was performed at the end of surgery (Fig.1d-e and Table 1), showing a mild hypocoagulation state.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and remained stable, with no bleeding during the recovery phase.
She was discharged from the ICU 3 days after admission and then 3 days later she was discharged from the hospital.

"The patient is a 57-year-old woman who had noted a rapidly enlarging mass on the left side of her neck in 2010.
She underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection, which revealed a 3.8-cm anaplastic thyroid cancer arising in a background of an oncocytic variant of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (Fig.1A, and Fig.S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
Resection margins were positive, and 3 of 12 lymph nodes were involved.
At 3 weeks after surgery, the serum thyroglobulin level was 17.2 ng per milliliter, with undetectable thyroglobulin antibodies.
The patient received concurrent radiation therapy and weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy.
The serum thyroglobulin level at 4 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy was 12.0 ng per milliliter.
Restaging scans obtained 3 months later revealed a new, right-sided hilar mass (Fig.1C), and the patient enrolled in a phase 2 clinical trial of everolimus, which was administered at a dose of 10 mg daily.
Within 6 months, follow-up scans showed that the lesion had greatly diminished in size (from 3.0 by 2.6 cm to 1.1 by 0.8 cm) (Fig.1D).
After 18 months of a sustained response to everolimus, scans revealed progressive disease (Fig.1E).
The patient underwent a mediastinoscopy with removal of an enlarged lymph node, which contained metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer (Fig.1B, and Fig.S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Whole-exome sequencing was performed on biopsy samples of the pretreatment and resistant tumors as well as on a blood sample.

"This is the case of a 58-year-old white Hispanic woman with a history of uveal melanoma in her right eye (Fig.1).
She was admitted to the hospital with jaundice and abdominal pain for 10 days.
On admission, laboratory tests were obtained (a complete blood count was within normal limits, amylase: 136 U/L, total bilirubin: 6.37 mg/dL with a direct fraction of 5.30 mg/dL).
Cross-sectional, abdominal computed tomography (CT) with contrast, showed a low-attenuating lesion localized in the pancreatic head (measuring 4 × 3 cm) and a thinner section of the distal bile duct suspicious for compression).
After a multidisciplinary meeting, our patient was scheduled for EUS-FNA.
EUS showed a solid, heteroechoic with predominantly hypoechoic areas, well-defined lesion with regular contours (measuring 3.1 × 2.6 cm), localized between the head and neck of the pancreas (Fig.2).
There was no vascular or lymph node invasion identified.
EUS-FNA was performed with a 22G needle using the fanning technique.
In the cytology specimens (Fig.3), the cells presented have a discohesive dispersed pattern, with marked variation in size and shape including epithelioid and spindle-shaped cells with plasmacytoid and round nuclei.
The nuclear chromatin is clumping and irregular with excessive parachromatin clearing, there are single or multiple macronucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm with deep brownish-black granules obscuring the cell details.
The background shows necrosis and hemorrhage.
Our patient underwent right orbital exenteration and followed by duodenopancreatectomy (the Whipple procedure), without any complications (Fig.4).
The surgical specimen showed undifferentiated cells, with extended disposition of brown pigment, infiltrating the pancreas and the serosa of the duodenal wall.
Immunohistochemistry was positive for Melan-A, HMB45, vimentin, S-100 protein and negative for cytokeratin, all consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma.
At the moment, our patient is receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at an outside oncology clinic.

"Our patient (ID 73387) is a female child, born by an emergency caesarean section at 34 weeks of gestation to consanguineous, first-cousin British Pakistani parents.
Antenatal scans showed that she was small for her gestation, weighing 1.19 kg at birth with a head circumference of 26.7 cm, considerably below the 0.4th centile.
Induction of labour had been attempted because of the growth retardation but had failed, leading to the emergency caesarean section.
The Apgar scores were 4 at 1 min, 7 at 5 min and 9 at 10 min.
She was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for continuous positive airway pressure ventilation.
At a few hours of age, she developed a severe lactic acidosis.
The initial lactic acid concentration was 22 mmol/l and subsequently increased to 63 mmol/l (normal range, 0.7–2.1 mmol/l).
She was treated with intravenous infusions of sodium bicarbonate and Tris-hydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM), but it was never possible to correct the metabolic acidosis.
She also developed hypoglycaemia within hours of birth that was corrected with an intravenous infusion of 15% glucose (7.8 mg/kg/min).
The ammonia concentration was normal.
Urine organic acid profile showed massive excretion of lactic acid and increased phenolic acids, especially hydroxyphenyllactate.
Plasma amino acids showed raised concentrations of alanine and glutamine (1567 and 1369 μmol/l, respectively), consistent with the lactic acidosis; several other amino acids were also mildly increased.
There was gross generalised aminoaciduria.
Blood acylcarnitine analysis was normal.
Echocardiography showed a structurally normal heart and good ventricular function.
Cranial ultrasound showed bilateral intraventricular cysts within the frontal horns and anterior portions of the lateral ventricles.
The left-sided cysts were larger, up to 15 mm in diameter, whereas the largest cyst on the right was 8 mm in diameter.
The choroid plexuses were hyperechoic and irregular, suggesting previous intraventricular haemorrhage.
Abdominal ultrasound showed a distended urinary bladder but was otherwise unremarkable.
There was severe coagulopathy with an extended prothrombin time of 47.7 s (normal 12.3–16.6 s), a very low plasma albumin of 7 g/l (normal 35–50 g/l), otherwise normal liver function tests but a raised creatine kinase of 2700 U/l (normal <300 U/l).
She was transferred to a tertiary centre because of her worsening metabolic acidosis.
She started having seizures at ∼48 h of age.
Despite infusions of bicarbonate and THAM, her acidosis continued to worsen.
Muscle and skin biopsies were performed and the family agreed to the withdrawal of intensive care treatment.
She died aged 55 h.
All documented studies were approved and performed under the ethical guidelines issued by each of our Institutions for clinical studies, with written informed consent obtained from the family.

"An 11-year-old boy presented with a history of headaches and vomiting that had been present for several months.
Physical examination showed papilledema without the presence of any other neurological deficits.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large prepontine mass with dorsal displacement of the brainstem and a secondary obstructive hydrocephalus due to compression of the aqueduct.
The lesion had an inhomogeneous hypointense aspect on the T1-weighted image (T1WI) and an inhomogeneous hyperintense aspect on the T2-weighted image (T2WI).
After administration of IV gadolinium, there was some inhomogeneous enhancement (Fig.1).
Computed tomography (CT) imaging showed no bone involvement.
During the first operation, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted into the right lateral ventricle to treat the hydrocephalus.
A careful study of the MRI suggested that this infra- and supratentorially located tumour might be resected through a single approach.
A left frontotemporal transsylvian approach was performed to gain access to the tumour.
The tumour had well-defined margins and was entirely located in the intradural plane.
There were no attachments to the cranial nerves or brainstem.
A macroscopic complete resection was performed.
Postoperatively, the patient had developed a left oculomotor nerve palsy, which completely recovered within the next 4 weeks.
The postoperative MRI showed a complete removal of the tumour (Fig.2).
After careful consideration by a multidisciplinary team, we decided that there was no indication for postoperative radiation therapy.
At follow-up one and a half years later, the patient was found to have remained asymptomatic.
There were no signs of tumour recurrence on the MRI scan.
At a follow-up of more than 6 years after treatment, there were still no signs of tumour recurrence on the MRI scan.
Histological examination showed a slightly lobulated tumour consisting of a chondromyxoid matrix.
The tumour cells showed a vacuolated and pale cytoplasm.
Moderate nuclear polymorphism was observed but no obvious mitotic activity (Fig.3).
Some calcifications were seen.
The tumour cells stained positive for pan-keratin, S-100 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).
These findings suggest a histopathological diagnosis of chordoma.

"A 75–year–old female presented in the Emergency Department of Ilfov Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, Romania, with dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremities swelling, palpitations.
She had a 3 years history of atrial fibrillation diagnosed by her family doctor and one-year history of cardiac failure NYHA (New York Heart Association) class Ⅱ.
Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse 80 beats/min, blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, bi–basal crackles on chest auscultation, lower extremities swelling.
Heart sounds examination revealed a IVth degree pansystolic murmur at the left border of the stern.
The jugular veins were dilated.
The patient complained of pain in the upper right abdominal region, enhanced by palpation.
The liver margin was tender, round, of 6 cm below the costal rib, with a smooth liver surface.
The spleen could not be felt.
EKG: atrial fibrillation of 80/min, right bundle branch block, infero-lateral ischemia.
Transabdominal ultrasound showed a homogenous, enlarged liver.
The suprahepatic veins were dilated, as well as the inferior vena cava (30 mm, without respiratory variations).
Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a dilated right atrium of 74,2 mm (Figure 1), dilated left atrium of 55,2 mm, dilated left ventricle of 64/72,3 mm, dilated right ventricle of 44,4 mm.
Atrial septal defect ostium secundum type, of 6 cm (Figure 2), with left–to–right shunt.

"CASE: A 28-year-old previously healthy man presented with a 6-week history of palpitations.
The symptoms occurred during rest, 2–3 times per week, lasted up to 30 minutes at a time and were associated with dyspnea.
Except for a grade 2/6 holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation murmur (best heard at the left sternal border with inspiratory accentuation), physical examination yielded unremarkable findings.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm and a Wolff– Parkinson– White pre-excitation pattern (Fig.1: Top), produced by a right-sided accessory pathway.
Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated the presence of Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve, with apical displacement of the valve and formation of an “atrialized” right ventricle (a functional unit between the right atrium and the inlet [inflow] portion of the right ventricle) (Fig.2).
The anterior tricuspid valve leaflet was elongated (Fig.2C, arrow), whereas the septal leaflet was rudimentary (Fig.2C, arrowhead).
Contrast echocardiography using saline revealed a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunting and bubbles in the left atrium (Fig.2D).
The patient underwent an electrophysiologic study with mapping of the accessory pathway, followed by radiofrequency ablation (interruption of the pathway using the heat generated by electromagnetic waves at the tip of an ablation catheter).
His post-ablation ECG showed a prolonged PR interval and an odd “second” QRS complex in leads III, aVF and V2–V4 (Fig.1Bottom), a consequence of abnormal impulse conduction in the “atrialized” right ventricle.
The patient reported no recurrence of palpitations at follow-up 6 months after the ablation.

"A 55-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of a suspicion of mediastinal tumor incidentally found through a medical-checkup plain X-ray photography (X-P) (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A).
Chest MRI revealed a 3 cm diameter tumor which seemed to connect to the right lobe of thyroid and projected into the mediastinum (Figure ​1B).
By 123I-RI, no unusual accumulation was detected (Figure ​1C).
A fine needle aspiration biopsy, which is viewed as the “gold standard” for diagnosis in most cases, was tried but could not reach a conclusive diagnosis.
Thereby, 18F-FDG-PET was performed and a high accumulation was revealed with standardized uptake value (SUV) of 3.8 (Figure ​1D).
Thus, as a possibility of malignancy could not be excluded, the right lobe excision procedure for thyroid gland was enforced.
The obtained tumor was continuous to the right lobe as expected.
The surface was flat and smooth and the exfoliation from the circumference organization was easy (Figure ​2A).
Microscopically, the encapsulated tumor consisted of atypical large-sized follicles without malignant characteristics, the background thyroid tissue showing no remarkable change (Figure 2B).
Thus, histological diagnosis was follicular thyroid adenoma.
Ethical approval was not thought to be necessary because all the clinical course of the case was completely within usual medical cares.
Informed consent was given from the case on each occasion of diagnostic examinations and therapeutic procedures.

"A 65-year-old woman presented with a complaint of right upper quadrant pain.
Three years prior, the patient was incidentally diagnosed with idiopathic BCS during health checkup; Doppler ultrasound (US) examination showed obstruction of the middle and left hepatic veins, and investigations for underlying thrombophilia were unremarkable.
She was treated with warfarin to maintain an international normalized ratio between 2 and 3, but discontinued after at least 1 year due to non-compliance; the patient did not consult with any doctors for 2 years.
She has remained asymptomatic for the past 3 years until recently she started experiencing steadily worsening, intermittent pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen, with no associated or alleviating factors.
Physical examination was only notable for mild right upper quadrant tenderness.
Laboratory tests revealed mildly elevated bilirubin (2.2 mg/dL) and albumin deficit (2.38 g/dL).
Her Child-Pugh (CP) score was 8, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 11, Rotterdam score was 0.15, and BCS-TIPS prognostic index (BCS-TIPS PI) score was 6.3.
A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed non-visualized middle and left hepatic veins, hepatomegaly with hypertrophy of the caudate lobe, splenomegaly, hepatic venous collaterals, and a saccular aneurysm located at the extrahepatic portal vein main branch measuring 3.2 cm in height and 2.5 cm × 2.4 cm in diameter (Figure ​1A).
The aneurysm was thought to be associated with BCS as there was no preceding history of trauma and it had not been present on Doppler US examination performed 3 years previously.
Although the patient had no ascites or variceal bleeding, the decision was made to create a TIPS to relieve hepatic venous outflow obstruction because of increasing pain and concern for complications due to aneurysm size; direct approach to the aneurysm was not considered due to risk of associated complications in the setting of portal hypertension, and stent-grafting was not considered due to concerns about patency in the settings of hepatic venous outflow obstruction and underlying thrombophilia.
After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the interventional radiology suite.
The procedure was performed with the patient under conscious sedation.
Portal vein access was obtained via the right hepatic vein under fluoroscopy, and portography showed a saccular aneurysm located at the main portal vein, extensive intrahepatic portal vein thrombosis, and small splenorenal varices (Figure ​2A).
A 10-mm diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) covered stent-graft (Fluency Plus; Bard Peripheral Vascular, Tempe, Arizona, United States) was deployed across the liver parenchymal tract; deploying the stent-graft into the main portal vein trunk to cover the aneurysm neck was not considered because it would obstruct blood flow to the portal vein branches.
Completion portography showed a widely patent shunt and markedly decreased aneurysm filling (Figure 2B).
The portosystemic pressure gradient (PPG) was decreased from 19 mmHg to 8 mmHg.
The patient recovered uneventfully and had complete resolution of her abdominal pain in 2 d.
She was discharged on long-term warfarin and remained asymptomatic after 1 year of follow-up.
Most recent laboratory tests revealed normal liver function, and Doppler US examination performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 mo postprocedure confirmed a patent shunt.
Her CP score was 5, MELD score was 8, Rotterdam score was 0.12, and TIPS-BCS PI score was 6.1.
CT scans showed that the aneurysm had decreased in size to 2.4 cm in height and 2.0 cm × 1.9 cm in diameter at 3 mo after TIPS (Figure 1B), and had further decreased to 1.9 cm in height and 1.6 cm × 1.5 cm in diameter at 1 year (Figure ​1C).

"A 45-year-old lady sought dermatology consultation for severely tender erythematous vesicles and bullae over back, chest and arms.
These were sudden in onset associated with fever, nausea and malaise.
Along with this she also complained of pain in upper abdomen.
There was no history of receiving any drugs prior to the onset of lesions.
She did not report any significant weight loss or loss of appetite.
On physical examination, her temperature was 38°C, pulse rate was 100/min and blood pressure was 126/72 mm Hg.
There were multiple coalescing vesicles and bullae over upper back, chest and arms distributed symmetrically showing areas of pustulation and necrosis.
Surrounding them were multiple pseudovesicular satellite papule (figure 1A,B).
On per abdominal examination mild tenderness was present in the right hypochondrium.
Patient's initial laboratory investigations showed a total leucocyte count of 12 000 cells/mm3 with 75% neutrophils.
The haemoglobin level was 14.3 gm% and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 30 mm/h.
Liver function test, kidney function test and C reactive protein levels were within normal limits.
Gram stain from purulent exudates showed only neutrophils without any organisms and culture did not show any growth after 72 h of incubation.
A lesional skin biopsy taken from the satellite papule showed neutrophilic infiltration in dermis with papillary dermal oedema and spongiosis (figure 2A,B).
Abdominal ultrasonography revealed intraluminal gall bladder mass suggestive of malignancy.
On the basis of these findings a final diagnosis of SS associated with gall bladder malignancy was made.
She was started on oral prednisolone in dose of 40 mg daily along with symptomatic treatment.
Her cutaneous lesions responded dramatically and subsided completely after 1 week of treatment (figure 3A,B).
Dose of prednisolone was tapered and an open cholecystectomy was performed.
Histopathology of excised tissue confirmed it to be well-differentiated gall bladder adenocarcinoma forming glands and papillae infiltrating the muscularis propria superficially.
Cystic duct cut margins were free of tumour (figure 2C,D).
Patient's postoperative period was uneventful and she was discharged on tapering doses of prednisolone with advice to follow-up periodically.

Laboratory tests were normal.
Nonspecific elevations of serum pancreatic enzymes.
Patient underwent an abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) that revealed: Aspect of ileitis of the last ileal loop extended by 300 mm with distended ileal loops upstream, cystic image at the tail of the pancreas with clean wall uncalcified and hypodense content of fluid density without endoluminal bourgeon or pancreatic duct dilatation, measuring 28 x 22mm (Figure 1).
The size of the head was normal.
There were no enlarged lymph nodes (Figure 2).
Aspect of bilateral sacroiliitis and bilateral coxarthrosis.
MRI show an aspect of ileitis of the last ileal loop and the cystic nature of a pancreatic lesion, with parietal enhancement at the caudal portion of the pancreas with a slight dilation of the Wirsung.
Otherwise, gallbladder contains multiple gallstones and biliary sludge.
Tumor markers are normal.on the other hand, in colonoscopy terminal ileum appears swollen, inflamed, with frequent ulcerations and biopsies were made.
The biopsies were taken and show a subacute and ulcerative ileitis compatible with Crohn's disease.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was normal.
The patient was operated by laparoscopy, he had a caudal pancreatectomy and cholecystectomy .1.5 cm cystic tumor in the tail of pancreas was resected and sent for pathological examination.
The post-operative course was uneventful.
Patient was discharged home within 7 days in a good general condition.
There were no symptoms of glucose intolerance after normal diet administration.
The microscopic examination revealed well differentiated cystic neuro endocrine tumor of the tail of the pancreas grade I according to the classification of WHO 2010 (mitosis <2/10CFG and Ki67<2% ) associated with neuroendocrine hyperplasia lesions of islets of Langerhans, surgical limit was healthy, pTNM pT2, ectopic spleen, chronic cholecystitis.
the patient come for out-patient consultations at the hospital, he felt well, with no severe complaints and with correct periodic findings and normal glucose metabolism.

"A 53 year old female without significant past medical history developed severe viral pneumonia, with rapid, progressive deterioration in her respiratory status.
She developed ARDS and mechanical ventilatory management using ARDS protocol were unable to maintain adequate oxygenation.
As a result, bedside VV-ECMO was planned.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to visualize proper positioning of the guidewire and cannula.
Using the Seldinger technique, the right internal jugular vein was accessed and a guide wire was placed.
Placement of the guidewire into the IVC proved difficult due to repeated migration of the guidewire into the right ventricle.
After multiple attempts, the guidewire was visualized to course properly from the SVC to the IVC.
After a bolus dose of 5000 units of intravenous heparin was given, the right internal jugular venous access site was dilated.
Just as the final dilatation was completed and upon dilator exchange with simultaneous advancement of the 23 French Avalon cannula, TEE lost visualization of the guidewire.
Multiple premature ventricular beats were noted and immediately, a new, rapidly enlarging pericardial effusion was detected (Figure ​(Figure2).2).
Emergent preparations were made for bedside surgical decompression of the pericardial space.
Quickly the patient lost blood pressure from acute cardiac tamponade.
The Avalon cannula was immediately clamped at the end but not removed.
A emergent subxiphoid pericardial window was performed, resulting in drainage of venous blood and restoration of blood pressure.
Transfusion was initiated and the patient was emergently transported to the operating room for surgical exploration.
The Avalon cannula was found to have perforated the apex of the right ventricle.
The injury was repaired primarily and the Avalon cannula was repositioned toward the IVC again by TEE with additional direct manipulation.
VV-ECMO was initiated and the oxygenation improved.
Due to excessive coagulopathies, the sternum was left open but was closed on postoperative day 2.
From that point, she remained free from any cardiac or infectious complications and her pulmonary condition slowly improved.
She was successfully weaned from VV-ECMO on postoperative day 9 and was discharged home on postoperative day 24 without the need for home oxygen.
She regained full physical functions at home and recovered normal pulmonary function by 3 months following discharge from the hospital.
"
"A 3-month-old infant from the UAE with a genetically-confirmed diagnosis of Jarcho-Levin syndrome and dependent on mechanical ventilation since birth was admitted to our centre for the implantation of VEPTRs.
We received an intubated patient, mechanically ventilated in a volume-controlled mode, with a 0.30–0.45 fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) of 23–45 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7 cm H2O, backup respiratory rate (RR) of 34).
A chest X-ray of the thorax was performed on admission (figure 1A), and a month after the first surgery (figure 1B), showing improvement of the bilateral posterior atelectasis in the base of the lungs.
Owing to the difficulty of progressing in the weaning process from mechanical ventilation after the VEPTRs were implanted to expand the thorax, a bronchoscopy was performed, showing bronchomalacia predominantly in both upper lobar bronchi.
As prolonged mechanical ventilation was expected, a tracheostomy was previously performed.
After an initial CT scan (figure 2A), a follow-up CT scan (figure 2B) a month after the surgery showed a resolution of the posterior-basal atelectasis, coinciding with a decrease of FiO2 to 0.21.
Postoperatively, the patient was on the Servo-i ventilator in a volume-controlled mode and needed variable PIPs between 25 and 45 cm H2O and PEEP values of 7–11 cm H2O.
During the attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator in the following months, he was unable to activate the inspiratory flow trigger and required significant sedoanalgesia to adapt to the ventilator due to repeated episodes of desaturation, on some occasions with bradycardia, associated to bronchial collapse.
He continued to have asynchrony which required boluses of sedation in addition to existing medications.
He initially received fentanyl and midazolam through a continuous infusion pump with progressive increase in the doses as well as continuous cisatracurium as a muscular relaxant to adapt to mechanical ventilation (figure 3).
As clinical stabilisation was achieved, the muscular relaxant was withdrawn and a progressive decrease of sedation was initiated along with a change in the drug regimen.
During this period, the patient developed an ocular flutter which was attributed to a pharmacological cause after neurological alterations were ruled out with normal EEG, ophthalmoscopy, metabolic workup and cranial MRI.
At 5 months of age, the NAVA mode started to improve the patient's adaptation to the ventilator through the use of a neural trigger.
The NAVA catheter additionally costs around €200 per catheter; according to the manufacturer it should be changed every 5 days.
It was required for 7 months; nevertheless the catheters were changed every 15 days without observing a deterioration of the Edi signal.
According to the literature, Jarcho-Levin syndrome does not appear with mental retardation and life expectancy is pretty long, so ethically, we considered that this patient should have an opportunity to overcome his thoracic insufficiency if it were technically possible.
Tachypnoea was initially observed with a RR of 55 without other signs of increase in his work of breathing and his RR eventually returned to normal for his age (40) over the next few days.
The synchrony achieved with the ventilator allowed a progressive decrease of the sedoanalgesia he received until it was completely withdrawn in 10 days; and the need for extra boluses of sedation was reduced to zero.
Concurrently to the reduction of sedation, his ocular flutter disappeared and he showed significant progress in his psychomotor development.
The settings used were: NAVA level of 1 cm H2O/µV, PEEP 11 cm H2O, Edi trigger 0.5 µV.
The patient had tidal volumes (Vt) of 6–7 mL/kg (figure 3).
After 10 days on the NAVA mode, he did not require any type of sedation and the sporadic episodes of bronchial collapse were resolved with a quick increase of PEEP to 20 cm H2O or manual ventilation with the self-inflating bag.
Once he was stabilised on the NAVA mode, his PIPs oscillated between 15 and 45 cm H2O with a NAVA level of 0.4 and Edi peaks between 15 and 100 µV.
A posterior pulmonary CT scan performed 2 months after the first surgery, 1 month after starting NAVA and prior to the first thoracic expansion, showed a significant reduction in the posterobasal atelectases previously observed (figure 2B).
When he turned 1 year old, after several attempts with different devices Trilogy 100 (Philips), Astral 150 (ResMed), the patient finally tolerated mechanical ventilation with a home ventilator (Monnal T-50, Air Liquide) in a volume assisted/controlled mode with the following settings: Vt 80 mL (9 mL/kg), PEEP 10 cm H2O, flow trigger 0.5 L/min.
His PIPs were around 30 cm H2O.
He did not tolerate a decrease of PEEP below 9 cm H2O or short disconnections from the ventilator.
Currently, the patient is 19 months old, is able to walk and his neurodevelopment seems to be normal.

"A 20-year-old previously healthy Bengali man presented to our hospital with anuria and features of uremic encephalopathy.
Ten days prior to this presentation, he had experienced severe upper abdominal pain and vomiting, and he had been treated in a primary care facility for having a case of acute pancreatitis.
His initial symptoms improved; however, he gradually became anuric and disoriented.
Then he was transferred to our hospital for further management.
At presentation to our hospital, he was severely agitated, restless, and disoriented.
He was tachypneic with acidotic breath.
Mild pedal edema was present; however, his jugular venous pressure was not raised.
His pulse was 112 beats/minute, his blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg, and his body temperature was 98 °F.
Signs of meningeal irritation were absent, and his plantar response was bilaterally extensor.
His fundus could not be evaluated, and examination of his other systems was unremarkable.
His laboratory parameters showed features of renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 13 mg/dl, serum urea 293 mg/dl), raised pancreatic enzymes (serum amylase 249 U/L [reference up to 100 U/L], serum lipase 227 U/L [reference 13–60 U/L), normal liver function tests (serum bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, alanine aminotransferase 38 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 35 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 122 U/L, serum albumin 37 g/L), normal potassium (5.1 mmol/L), normal bicarbonate (19 mmol/L), and normal triglycerides (173 mg/dl).
His serological markers, including antinuclear antibodies, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, C3, and C4, were within normal limits.
An ultrasonogram of his whole abdomen was unremarkable, but non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) findings were suggestive of acute pancreatitis (Fig.1).
His kidneys were unremarkable, however.
The patient was managed as having a case of AKI and acute pancreatitis.
Urgent hemodialysis was initiated.
After he had received two sessions of hemodialysis, his level of consciousness improved, but he complained of profound visual loss.
An assessment revealed only perception of light.
A funduscopic examination showed retinal whitening and extensive cotton wool exudates as well as Purtscher’s flecken (Fig.2) compatible with Purtscher’s retinopathy.
High-dose parenteral methylprednisolone (1 g intravenously once daily for 3 days) was administered.
For evaluation of renal dysfunction, a renal biopsy was done; the histopathological findings were compatible with renal cortical necrosis (Fig.3).
The patient denied substance abuse or alcohol ingestion.
He did not consume any nephrotoxic drugs or herbal products in the recent past.
No history suggesting connective tissue diseases was available, nor did he have a history of hypotension throughout the course of his current illness.
The patient was finally diagnosed with acute pancreatitis complicated with renal cortical necrosis leading to AKI and Purtscher’s retinopathy leading to complete bilateral blindness.
He died 16 months after his initial presentation as a result of a recurrent attack of acute pancreatitis.
Before that, he had been undergoing maintenance hemodialysis; however, his renal function did not recover, though his vision was improved to finger-counting at 2 feet.
"
"The patient was a 48-year-old man who had previously been hospitalized due to hemoptysis at 42 years of age.
At that time, a chest radiograph and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed diffuse ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the bilateral lung fields (Fig.1,2), and a bronchoscopic examination revealed the accumulation of large amounts of blood in the trachea and bronchi (Fig.3).
The patient's bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was bloody and contained numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
A culture test of the BALF revealed no findings.
An electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities.
A questionnaire that was completed at that time did not reveal the patient's hemorrhagic episode or a family history of bleeding disease, with the exception of his younger brother who had been diagnosed with hepatitis C.
Furthermore, he had not received any drugs that had the potential to cause DAH.
Following the above-mentioned examinations, DAH due to some sort of vasculitis was suspected.
Thus, treatment with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily) for 3 days followed by prednisolone (25 mg daily) was initiated.
This relieved his symptoms.
Chest CT showed the resolution of the GGO.
The patient's prednisolone dose was tapered and eventually discontinued at two-and-a-half years after his discharge from our hospital.
The patient was readmitted to our hospital with a recurrence of hemoptysis at 46 years of age.
The above-described therapy was initiated and led to the improvement of his condition.
The prednisolone dose was tapered from 60 mg daily to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily.
At 48 years of age, he was readmitted to our hospital with a further recurrence of hemoptysis.
At this point, he had steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, which was treated with glimepiride (3 mg daily).
At admission, his weight was 75 kg and height 167 cm; his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 178/102 mmHg; pulse rate, 109 beats/min, pulse oximetry, 97% in room air; and body temperature, 36.8°C.
Chest auscultation revealed fine crackles in the right lung field.
No skin rash, subcutaneous bleeding or joint swelling were present.
A chest radiograph and CT showed the presence of diffuse GGO in the bilateral lung fields.
Mild anemia was observed (hemoglobin, 11.3 g/dL), although hemoglobin levels had been 14.6 g/dL prior to the hemoptysis episode.
The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was prolonged to 53.5 seconds (normal range, 25.1-40.7 seconds).
Laboratory tests showed that the patient's blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were 299 mg/dL and 8.2%, respectively, due to the steroid-induced diabetes mellitus.
Autoantibodies for various collagen diseases were negative (Table).
We diagnosed the condition as a recurrence of DAH and again administered high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 days, followed by prednisolone (60 mg daily).
His condition improved, as had been observed during the previous episodes.
A further detailed inquiry regarding the patient's medical history revealed that, as an elementary school student, he had been hospitalized and had received blood transfusions twice following abnormally heavy bleeding after tooth extraction; however, a specific congenital bleeding disorder had not been diagnosed at that time.
It was also revealed that his younger brother had been diagnosed with hemophilia B during adolescence.
Considering the possibility of hemophilia, his blood coagulation factors were examined, revealing that his factor IX activity was 3%.
The patient was subsequently diagnosed with moderate hemophilia B.
By the time of this diagnosis, the patient's DAH had already resolved with the corticosteroid therapy.
We decided to continue treating the patient using prednisolone alone, without coagulation factor IX replacement therapy.
No recurrence of DAH or hemorrhagic symptoms have been observed during 3 years since the tapering and discontinuation of prednisolone.

"This young boy is the first child of healthy non-consanguineous, white British parents.
He was born at term following an uneventful pregnancy weighing 3132 g (9th–25th centile).
Early development was thought to be normal.
At approximately 6 months of age he developed tonic upward eye deviation associated with flexion of his arms and neck consistent with infantile spasms.
An electroencephalograph (EEG) at this time was grossly abnormal (hypsarrhythmia) and strongly supported a diagnosis of West Syndrome.
Cranial MRI was reported as normal.
Prednisolone was prescribed and treated the seizures effectively.
Steroids were weaned over 6 weeks and he remained seizure free for a further 6 months.
By the age of 1 year, it was apparent that his early developmental progress was not being maintained and that he was functioning at the 6–8 month developmental stage.
Seizures returned shortly after his first birthday and were prolonged, frequent and on occasion focal, involving his right arm, leg and right side of face.
Clonazepam briefly improved seizure frequency, but subsequently his epilepsy has proved refractory to various combinations of anticonvulsant therapy.
Prolonged seizures of more than 60 min have been associated with a stepwise regression in his neurodevelopment.
Seizure semiology is now predominantly one of epilepsia partialis continua involving the right side of his face, right arm and right leg.
The development of focal seizures and the progressive nature of the condition prompted a second cranial MRI at the age of 2 years 6 months.
By contrast with the previous scan, this MRI revealed symmetrical subcortical white matter lesions (Fig.1A) with thinning of the anterior and genu of the corpus callosum (Fig.1B).
On examination, the patient had small, round, anteriorly rotated ears and a broad nasal root.
He demonstrated no visual awareness but startled to loud noise.
Tone was increased in all 4 limbs with internal rotation of both legs at the hips.
Reflexes were pathologically brisk.
Brief myoclonic jerks were evident throughout the examination.
"
"A 60-year-old woman patient was admitted to our hospital on Feb. 18, 2016 because of frequent episodes of hemoptysis for 2 weeks.
In the previous decade, the patient had frequent but less severe episodes of hemoptysis, which typically ensued following an upper respiratory tract infection.
Ear, nose, and throat examination and laryngoscope failed to identify an apparent source of bleeding.
CT chest scan revealed no abnormality.
The most recent episode occurred after an upper respiratory tract infection 2 weeks ago.
The patient coughed up as much as about 500 mL of fresh blood in an episode of hemoptysis, which was alleviated by anti-tussive therapy.
The patient denied a history of smoking and illicit drug use.
Diagnostic workup revealed no evidence of coagulopathy.
Upon admission, physical examination revealed signs of rhonchi and reduced breath sounds.
Bronchoscopy showed a 1-cm lesion at the membranous trachea 2 cm to the carina.
Tortuous blood vessels were observed running in the submucosa of the trachea (Fig.1).
CT angiography was performed, demonstrating an artery extending into the submucosa from the descending aorta (Fig.2).
A diagnosis of Dieulafoy disease of the trachea was entertained.
Since the blood vessel was considered to be the culprit of hemoptysis, selective arterial embolization was performed 1 week later.
No fresh episode of acute hemoptysis was observed and the patient was still being followed up at the time of writing this report.
This study was approved by Ethics Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, and also got an informed written consent from the patient.

"Here, we describe another case in a 60-year-old man from San Francisco who had consumed raw pork while traveling in the Philippines.
In June 2003, this man became ill with fever, diaphoresis, headache, nausea, and anorexia.
He had just returned from a 7-month vacation in the Philippines.
Three days after symptoms onset, his physician prescribed doxycycline.
Symptoms continued and he was admitted to a local hospital 5 days later with a fever of 38.9°C, nuchal rigidity, headache, and general malaise.
The patient described no recent contact with sick persons; past medical history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, he was somnolent but fully oriented, with no focal findings on neurologic examination and only slight nuchal rigidity.
He had a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3, including 16,400/mm3 neutrophils.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed leukocyte count of 487/μL with 80% polymorphonuclear cells and 18% lymphocytes, and glucose and protein levels <20 mg/dL and <167 mg/dL, respectively.
Gram stain of CSF showed gram-positive cocci in pairs (Figure).
Empiric therapy (ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ampicillin) for bacterial meningitis was begun.
Computed tomographic scan of the head showed only sinusitis; findings of chest radiograph and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative.
On hospital day 2, blood cultures grew gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.
The organism was catalase-negative, bile esculin-negative, and pyrrolidonyl aminopeptidase-negative, consistent with Streptococcus spp.
A latex agglutination test did not detect Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the isolate was sensitive to penicillin (MIC = 0.03), ceftriaxone, and vancomycin but resistant to tetracycline and clindamycin.
Antimicrobial therapy was changed to penicillin G, 24 million units intravenously per day.
On hospital day 5, the patient complained of hearing loss in his left ear.
Results of nasopharyngeal endoscopy were negative.
By hospital day 7, the organism was identified by the API 20 Strep System (bioMerieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France), as S. suis serotype 2.
The patient subsequently stated that he was a butcher with a culinary preference for partially cooked pork, which he had eaten in the Philippines until the week prior to onset of symptoms.
On hospital day 9, a formal audiology evaluation showed severe bilateral sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss (–70 dB).
The patient completed a 10-day course of parenteral antimicrobial drugs and was discharged on continued oral therapy with close followup.
Two months after discharge, the patient reported much improved hearing without other sequelae.

"A 44-year-old Chinese man with a 7 pack-year smoking history was referred to Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital in February 2013 for a left upper lobe lung mass with multiple bilateral intrapulmonary metastases, left pleural effusion, and 2R/4R/10L/11L lymphadenopathy.
Pleural fluid cytology revealed adenocarcinoma and Scorpion Amplification Refractory Mutation system (AmoyDx Co., Xiamen, China).
showed no detectable epidermal growth factor receptor mutation.
He commenced chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin.
However, after a single cycle, his symptoms worsened and imaging confirmed progressive disease.
A second opinion was requested from the University of Colorado and a computed tomography–guided biopsy of the left upper lobe lesion was performed to permit additional molecular testing.
In the interim, the patient commenced pemetrexed and nedaplatin.
Unfortunately, after two cycles his shortness of breath worsened, with evidence of further progression on his scans (Fig.1A).
Molecular testing on his repeat biopsy specimen revealed no mutations by SNaPshot multiplex PCR testing (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
However, although technically negative, the ALK break-apart FISH test showed an atypical negative pattern.
Specifically, 68% of cells demonstrated single copies of the 5′ ALK signal and numerous cells with doublets of the 5′ ALK signal combined with one 3′ ALK signal (Fig.2A).
Subsequently, confirmatory diagnostic assays demonstrated ALK protein expression by IHC using the D5F3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA; H score = 150; Fig.2B) and the presence of an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK transcript (E13; A20) by RT-PCR (Fig.2C).
The patient then received crizotinib (250 mg twice daily) as third-line therapy in May 2013 with an impressive symptomatic improvement and CT response after 1 month of therapy (Fig.1B).
He remains on treatment with crizotinib with no evidence of progression as of September 2013.

"A 57-year-old Jewish man with Crohn's disease (CD) of the ileum diagnosed at the age of thirteen, presented with multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs); these had developed over the past 16 years coinciding with the initiation of a prolonged course of the thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (mercaptopurine, 6-MP).
He was diagnosed with a total of 84 NMSC: 72 NMSC at our clinic, 12 from other clinics.
He was also awaiting biopsy and removal for additional lesions.
His CD was initially treated with sulfasalazine and intermittent steroids at diagnosis, but for the past 20 years he had been taking 6-MP daily.
In the first ten years after beginning 6-MP he developed 30 NMSC; 14 were squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 16 were basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
The patient was then treated elsewhere for the subsequent ten years.
This past year, however, he returned to the clinic with over 100 new lesions suggestive of malignancy on his torso and extremities.
Subsequent to this exam, he had 42 biopsy-proven lesions of NMCS; 20 were SCC and 22 were BCC.
In addition, three of the SCCs were moderately differentiated and two were poorly differentiated and some of his larger skin cancers have necessitated Mohs surgery and xenografting.
The largest of his lesions was pretibial and measured 64x53 mm (Figure 1).
He was awaiting biopsy for many other suspicious lesions.
The patient had Fitzpatrick II skin type and admitted to excessive sun exposure for 25 years in Hawai‘i.
Early on he did not use sunscreen, and would sail a catamaran during peak sun hours.
He also revealed that his mother had one skin cancer lesion removed and denied ever having been a smoker.
Within the past year he discontinued 6-MP and began using mesalamine (Pentasa) and later adalimumab (Humira) hoping to attenuate the progression of NMSC, and continued to have monthly skin exams.
Overall, he was hospitalized 16 times for his CD, but never required any intestinal resection.
Unfortunately, in his most recent hospitalization he was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the small bowel, and passed away shortly after.

"A woman in her 60s was found to have screen detected invasive lobular breast carcinoma of the right breast and invasive ductal carcinoma, no special type, of the left breast.
Staging CT imaging prior to mastectomy showed a 12 cm pelvic mass which on initial impression was thought to be a fibroid uterus.
Associated postmenopausal bleeding led to pelvic ultrasound, hysteroscopy and biopsy.
The biopsy showed undifferentiated sarcoma, unclassifiable with immunohistochemistry.
Following discussion at a multidisciplinary team meeting it was felt that the uterine tumour was a separate primary malignancy rather than metastasis from the breast.
Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for both treatment purposes and to fully categorise the malignancy to guide further adjuvant therapy.
Histological examination of the resection specimen showed a partially necrotic tumour with a discrete outline located within and extending throughout the myometrium.
The tumour was composed of malignant spindle cells (figure 1A), with an intermittent component of pleomorphic cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.
Plentiful osteoclast-like giant cells were present (figure 1B).
Mitoses were numerous and structurally abnormal forms were common.
Neoplastic cells were surrounded by hyaline osteoid matrix and foci of coarse neoplastic woven bone (figure 1C).
Generous sampling of the tumour showed no admixed neoplastic epithelial elements, thus ruling out the more common carcinosarcoma (malignant mixed Müllerian tumour).
Tumour cells showed immunohistochemical expression for vimentin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin (focally) and CD99.
Epithelial markers were not expressed.
The morphological and immunohistochemical appearances were in keeping with primary uterine osteoblastic variant of osteosarcoma.
Unfortunately, despite treatment, further CT imaging showed the development of multiple peritoneal and pulmonary deposits, confirmed on biopsy to be metastatic osteosarcoma.
The patient received palliative chemotherapy and died several months later.
"
"A 70-year-old male was admitted to our hospital for perioperative cardiac evaluation of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
The patient had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for severe stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) 4 years before, which consisted of the right internal thoracic artery (RITA) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the left circumflex artery (LCX).
Due to continual growth of the abdominal aortic aneurysm over the years, surgery was indicated.
Left coronary angiogram showed 90 % stenosis of the LMCA and total occlusion of both grafts.
PCI was performed for LMCA stenosis (Fig.1).
A 7-Fr sheath was inserted into the right femoral artery, and a CLS4 guiding catheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) was engaged into the left coronary artery (LCA) ostium.
A guidewire (SION Blue, Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) was inserted into the distal LAD, and another guidewire (Hi-Torque Pilot 50, Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, California, USA) was inserted into the distal LCX.
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) (Intra-focus WR, Terumo Corp, Tokyo, Japan) demonstrated heavy circumferential calcification in the LMCA lesion.
After a 4.0 × 15-mm Quantum Maverick balloon catheter (Boston Scientific) was inflated in the lesion, LCA angiogram revealed a large dissection (Fig.2).
A 4.0 × 28-mm Multi-Link Vision stent (Abbott Vascular) was immediately deployed.
Angiographic image of the residual dissection disappeared and the stent was dilated by a 5.0 × 15-mm Quantum Maverick balloon catheter.
The absence of residual dissection was confirmed by angiography after stent implantation.
Next, LMCA-LAD and LMCA-LCX kissing balloon angioplasty was initiated using a 4.0 × 28-mm stent delivery balloon in the LAD and a 3.0 mm × 15-mm Ikazuchi balloon (Kaneka Medics, Tokyo, Japan) in the LCX.
The final angiographic imaging showed optimal results, and IVUS imaging of the lesion showed completely sealing by the stent (Fig.3).
A large hematoma at the femoral puncture site and local bleeding was observed after removal of the femoral sheath and manual compression was applied for haemostasis.
The hematoma did not appear to have spread the next day and the patient was discharged from the hospital on the fifth day after PCI.
Unexpectedly, the patient was admitted to our emergency room with new-onset chest pain and dyspnoea the next day after the discharge.
His vital signs indicated cardiogenic shock.
Electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in leads V1-V3.
Although echocardiography could not detect left ventricular asynergy, a large mass on the outflow tract of right ventricular chamber was observed (Fig.4).
Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a 40-mm hematoma compressing the main pulmonary artery trunk and the right ventricle (Fig.5).
During examination, the patient suffered sudden cardiopulmonary arrest.
He received immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation and returned to spontaneous circulation after the insertion of a percutaneous cardiopulmonary support device.
The patient underwent emergent surgery for the removal of the hematoma after informed consent was obtained from the patient's family.
During surgery, large, dark red clots between the pulmonary artery trunk and aorta were observed.
The suspected origin of the epicardial hematoma was blood oozing from the LMCA stent site.
Despite successful surgical repair, the patient died from aortic rupture induced by external cardiac massage.

"A 42-year-old woman presented with a right breast lump, lower back pain, loss of height, marked kyphosis and hepatomegaly.
Core biopsies from the breast lump showed ductal carcinoma in situ (sample labelled P1.1; Supplementary Fig.1 and Supplementary Table 1).
An additional biopsy from an ipsilateral axillary lymph node (P1.2) revealed metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma (ER+ (8/8) and HER2+ (3+)).
Computed tomography scan revealed widespread metastatic disease in bones, pleura and liver (Supplementary Fig.2 and Supplementary Table 2).
The patient was started on treatment with trastuzumab and taxane-based chemotherapy, with a significant partial response (Supplementary Fig.3).
After induction chemotherapy, she was maintained on tamoxifen and trastuzumab.
After 19 months on treatment, she presented with seizures and head computed tomography revealed a large metastasis in the left frontal lobe (Supplementary Fig.4), which was resected (M2.1).
Therapy with tamoxifen and trastuzumab was continued and collection of plasma samples was initiated (samples T1–T9).
Four months after surgery, she had enlarging liver lesions and a new metastatic deposit in the left ovary (Supplementary Fig.5).
Treatment was switched to a combination of lapatinib and capecitabine, resulting in stable disease for 12 months (Supplementary Fig.6).
General deterioration then occurred, with disease progression in the chest (new pulmonary nodules, bilateral pleural effusions and posterior chest wall mass, Supplementary Fig.7; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2–3).
Treatment was stopped and the patient died ∼4 months later.
Tumour samples were obtained at diagnosis from the primary breast site (P1.1) and an axillary lymph node (P1.2); after 19 months from the brain metastasis area (M2.1); and at autopsy after 3 years on treatment (from the primary breast site, and from metastatic deposits in the chest, liver, ovary and vertebrae, labelled P3.1 and M3.1–M3.4, respectively).
Serial plasma samples were obtained over the last 500 days of clinical follow-up (T1–T9).
Tumour and plasma samples collected and the clinical course are summarized in Fig.1a,b.

"A 60-year-old male visited our outpatient clinic with a mass on his left hip.
He had diabetes and alcoholic hepatitis.
On physical examination, a large mass measuring 10 cm in diameter was observed on his hip and an approximate 5 cm left inguinal lymph node was palpable (Figure ​1).
Serum tumor markers, including CEA and CA 19-9, were within normal limits, whereas serum amylase (227 IU/L, normal range 43-116 IU/L), lipase (378 IU/L, normal range 7-60), fasting blood sugar (144 mg/dL, normal range, 70-100 mg/dL), and liver function test levels [including aspartate aminotransferase (178 IU/L, normal range, 7-38 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (225 IU/L; normal range, 4-43 IU/L), and serum alkaline phosphatase (370 IU/L, normal range, 103-335 IU/L)] were all above normal ranges.
An abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan demonstrated not only a left hip mass and an enlarged left inguinal lymph node, but also a huge heterogeneous enhancing mass on the body of the pancreas (Figure ​2).
On a PET scan, additional metastases were not found.
We planned a staged surgery and performed a hip and inguinal mass excision on December 19, 2014.
The histopathological report revealed a metastatic small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with a maximal diameter of 10.5 cm on the buttock mass and a 7 cm growth on an inguinal lymph node.
The mitotic index was over 50 mitoses per 50 HPF and the Ki-67 index measured at 50%.
On January 21, 2015, we performed a total pancreatectomy and a total gastrectomy, with the findings revealing a tumor of the body of the pancreas about 9 cm × 6 cm in diameter involving the left gastric artery, splenic artery, and splenic vein.
The histopathological report was the same as that of a metastatic lesion.
Additionally, the tumor had spread to 8 of the 32 lymph nodes (Figure ​3).
On the 7th post-operative day, the patient developed a high fever and leukocytosis.
We administered an abdominal CT scan, which revealed infected fluid collection in the lesser sac and a 4.7 cm-sized recurring mass which was detected at the operative bed of the left hip (Figure ​(Figure4).4).
After infection of the abdominal cavity was treated by antibiotics, we removed the left hip recurring mass on February 3, 2015.
The histopathology was the same as in the previous report; with a maximum diameter of 7.5 cm.
The patient was discharged without other complications on February 9, 2015.
He is currently receiving chemotherapy based on etoposide and cisplatin treatment.

"A 31-year-old man developed diabetes insipidus with urine volume up to 10 to 20 L every 24 hours in 2003.
Four years later, he complained of fatigue, anorexia, jaundice and pruritus, and a symptomatic occipital mass.
Laboratory tests showed an abnormal liver enzyme (Table ​1), the patient was negative for hepatitis viruses.
As shown in Fig.1, abdominal MRI showed multiple low-density lesions in the liver on the T1-weighted image and obvious expansion of the intrahepatic bile duct on the T2-weighted image.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed multifocal intrahepatic bile duct strictures and dilatation, but the common hepatic duct was normal, it was highly suggestive of SC.
The neurohypophyseal area MRI showed the thickened hypothalamic nuclei and a low-density signal of 4.9 × 5.6 mm in size in the hypothalamic-pituitary area.
A multisystem, high-risk organ LCH was confirmed after occipital mass was biopsied in the local hospital, the patient was given ursodeoxycholic acid 150 mg 3 times a day.
Then, he began to receive a course of COEP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, 1000 mg; vincristine, 2 mg; epirubicin, 90 mg; and prednisone, 90 mg) in 2009.
However, on the 5th day of the 1st COEP chemotherapy, the patient appeared to severe liver function injury with an obvious increase of serum bilirubin (Table 1).
He refused further chemotherapy.
One year later, the patient developed liver decompensation with bleeding esophageal varices, ascites, and splenomegaly, and he was referred to LT (Model for End Stage Liver Disease score 17).
He underwent successful orthotopic LT in November 2011 in our center, and the donor came from voluntary deceased citizen organ donation in China.
Liver histopathology after LT revealed micronodular cirrhosis with SC and positive immunostaining (CD1a and S100), suggestive of LCH involving in the liver (Fig.2).
Postoperatively, the man continued to be immunosuppressed with tacrolimus and mycofenolate mofetil.
The patient is currently well with normal liver function and no evidence of recurrence of LCH for 4 and a half years follow-up.

"The 36-year-old male patient in this case had a 6-year history of diffuse cutaneous SSc (Fig.1) and had not received regular follow-up or medication therapy.
He had experienced malaise, poor appetite, and progressive shortness of breath for 1 month and oligouria for 3 days.
He was admitted to our hospital with renal failure and pulmonary edema.
In the emergency department, his blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate were 174/127 mm Hg, 88/min, and 22/min, respectively.
Laboratory analysis revealed the following values: white blood cell count, 7730/μL (3500–11,000/μL); hemoglobin, 8.6 g/dL (12–16 g/dL): platelet count, 87000/μL (150,000–400,000/μL); blood urea nitrogen, 78 mg/dL (6–21 mg/dL); creatinine, 8.9 mg/dL (1.1–1.5 mg/dL); calcium, 8.2 mg/dL (8.8–10.3 mg/dL); phosphorus, 5.4 mg/dL (2.7–4.5 mg/dL); haptoglobin, <6.56 mg/dL (30–200 mg/dL); and lactate dehydrogenase, 547 U/L (106–211 U/L).
A routine urinalysis revealed a proteinuria score of 2+ (200 mg/dL), white blood cell count of 3–5/high power field, and red blood cell count of 25–50/high power field.
The autoimmune profile indicated an antinuclear antibody level of 1:320 (speckles; normal, <1:40).
Tests for anti-Scl70, anti-double-stranded DNA, anti-Ro, anti-La, and anticardiolipin antibodies were all negative.
Kidney echogram showed a decreased bilateral kidney size without hydronephrosis.
Despite the chronic changes visible on the echogram, the patient had developed acute pulmonary edema and oligouria only 3 days before admission.
Accordingly, a clinical diagnosis of acute-on-chronic renal failure was made.
A further diagnosis of SRC was supported by the presence of renal failure with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and hypertension, and the patient was started on captopril therapy.
The sustained deterioration in renal function and anuria had led to a requirement for regular hemodialysis from admission.
After 3 days, captopril was changed to amlodipine because the patient developed a severe, intolerable cough thought to be associated with captopril.
His systolic blood pressure was controlled between 140 and 180 mm Hg.
At approximately 3 weeks after the initiation of maintenance hemodialysis, the patient newly developed a generalized tonic-clonic seizure disorder.
A brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a small lacunar infarct over the left basal ganglion without intracranial hemorrhage or large infarct.
The seizure resolved spontaneously without anticonvulsants, and the patient was finally discharged home without incident and scheduled for regular hemodialysis thrice weekly.
However, at 1 week after discharge, the patient developed a sudden-onset headache and vomiting with confusion and recurrence of the generalized tonic-clonic seizure.
He presented at the emergency department with a blood pressure of 183/100 mm Hg, platelet count of 149,000/μL, serum LDH of 332 U/L, and a peripheral blood smear containing 2–3 schizocytes/HPF (Fig.2).
Brain CT revealed no interval change, and lumbar puncture revealed traumatic tapping only.
Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and viruses.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral hyperintensity in the occipital and parietal lobes on a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence (Fig.3).
Finally, the patient was diagnosed with PRES.
We resumed captopril therapy at a dose of 25 mg thrice daily.
As it was difficult to differentiate SRC from TTP, we also considered plasma exchange treatment.
However, the patient's mental status returned to normal within 3 days in the absence of plasma exchange, and a follow-up MRI of the brain 2 months later showed complete resolution of cerebral edema (Fig.4).
Therefore, SRC-related PRES was confirmed.
Although the patient experienced a full neurologic recovery, his renal function did not improve and he remained dialysis dependent.

"This 16-year-old boy was the first child to non-consanguineous parents.
His parents and two younger siblings were healthy.
He was well until starting school at 7 years of age when he was found to be short in height, slightly myopic, astigmatic and to have subnormal visual acuity.
Endocrinological investigations were performed that initially revealed borderline values for growth hormone (GH) deficiency and he was therefore treated for a period with GH without any beneficiary effect on his growth.
At age 16 years, height and weight was −3 SD below the mean compared with a standardized Swedish growth chart.
Ophthalmological investigations at 10 years of age showed pigmentary retinopathy and optic atrophy.
An electroretinogram was performed and showed a severe rod cone dystrophy.
He had decreased visual acuity, visual fields, color vision, and dark adaption.
Nystagmus has been noted since 14 years of age.
A year later, photophobia and bilateral cataracts were developed.
The cataracts were operated on at 16 years of age.
He is now blind.
At 14 years of age, he was referred for neurological investigations.
A clinical examination showed mild ataxia with tremor, dysmetria and gait instability together with mild to moderate muscle weakness, weak to absent tendon reflexes in the lower extremities, and exercise intolerance.
Audiometric investigations revealed a mild bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment.
At 15 years of age, he had an unprovoked epileptic seizure and he has since then been treated with levetiracetam.
Decreased renal function was identified at 15 years of age, with increased serum creatinine to 145 μmol/l (reference interval 30–90 μmol/l), proteinuria with urine albumine at 244–538 mg/l (reference interval<20 mg/l), and urine albumine/creatinine ratio at 44–59 g/mol (reference interval <3 g/mol).
A renal scintigraphy demonstrated reduced kidney size.
Cr51-EDTA clearance showed a decreased glomerular filtration rate of 42% of normal.
The filtration rate decreased over time to 29% of normal at 16 years of age.
Since 14 years of age, cardiac investigations have demonstrated hypertrophy of the walls of the left ventricle (+3 SD compared with normal) with normal systolic and diastolic function and without obstruction of the outflow.
Mitochondrial investigations were performed at 14 years of age.
Blood levels of lactate and pyruvate were 1.6 and 0.096 mmol/l, respectively, leading to a ratio of 33 (reference interval <20), while cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of lactate and pyruvate were 3.6 and 0.137 mmol/l, respectively, leading to a lactate to pyruvate ratio of 26.
The urinary lactate excretion was normal.
The CSF albumin was increased to 258 mg/l (reference level <225 mg/l) and he also had an increased CSF/plasma albumin ratio of 7.4 (reference level <5).
The serum acyl carnitine profile and muscle carnitine levels were normal.
The serum creatine kinase activity was mildly increased to 5.4 μkat/l (reference interval <3.5 μkat/l).
"
"A 76-year-old woman presented to our hospital with complaints of epigastralgia since a day prior to admission.
Laboratory data on admission revealed an elevation of aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, ɤ-guanosine triphosphate, and alkaline phosphatase.
Serum total bilirubin and tumor markers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), SPan-1, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), were all within normal ranges.
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed a mass in an enlarged gallbladder and bulky hepatic lymph nodes surrounding the hepatic hilum (Fig.1a, ​b).
There were also no apparent lesions in upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy.
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) was performed to obtain tissue from the hilar lymph node.
Immunohistochemical staining of the specimen identified diffuse positivity for keratin, CD56, and synaptophysin in the tumor cells, which is consistent with NEC.
An endoscopic naso-gallbladder drainage (ENGBD) catheter was placed, and the bile cytology revealed class V malignant cells.
Therefore, positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination was performed to evaluate other primary or metastatic lesions.
It revealed that no other accumulated lesions were identified, and the accumulation of 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was in the gallbladder (SUVmax 7.8) and lymph nodes (SUVmax 13.4) (Fig.1c, d).
On the basis of these findings, the most likely diagnosis was a gallbladder NEC that was confined to the regional hepatic hilar lymph nodes metastasis.
Finally, we decided to perform surgical resection prior to chemotherapy because of concerns about complications developing from mechanical obstruction of the hepatic hilum by the enlarged lymph node.
She underwent cholecystectomy, hepatic hilar lymphadenectomy, extrahepatic biliary duct resection, and hepaticojejunostomy.
The bulky lymph nodes were totally resected as “en bloc”.
There were no apparent residual lesions surgically.
The postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged on the tenth day after surgery.
Macroscopically, the tumor was 58 × 42 mm in size and was located in the fundus, which contained a yellowish gallstone (Fig.2a).
A portion of the hepatic hilar lymph nodes (71 × 37 mm) was also excised separately (Fig.2b).
Microscopic examination of the gallbladder revealed a moderate to well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma infiltrating from the mucosa to the muscular layer, but not the serosal surface, without any NEC components (Fig.2c, ​d).
The tumor cells in the gallbladder are slightly positive for synaptophysin and CD56, but negative for chromogranin A (Fig.2e–g).
The resection margin from the liver bed was negative for tumor cells.
The epithelium around the carcinoma showed intestinal metaplasia with the goblet cells (Fig.4a), which area was stained by alcian blue (Fig.4b).
On the other hand, the hepatic hilar lymph nodes were composed of small round tumor cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm (Fig.3a).
Some of the tumor cells were large and had vesicular nuclei.
The tumor cells were arranged in sheets, cords, or in a trabecular or rosette fashion and were interspersed with focal necrosis.
They were immunohistochemically positive for CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A (Fig.3b–3d).
The mitotic count was 24 per 10 high-power microscopic fields, and the Ki-67 proliferation index was 70–80%, consistent with NEC.
The surgical dissection margin of the hepatic lymph nodes was microscopically cauterized within the tumor cells.
There was no invasion to the extrahepatic biliary duct.
As the result of thorough pathological re-evaluation by total segmentation, a negligible area of adenocarcinoma was detected in the lymph nodes (Fig.3e, ​f).
The adenocarcinoma component and the intestinal metaplastic epithelium in the gallbladder were both positive for CDX2 (Fig.4a), but the neuroendocrine component in hilar lymph nodes was negative for CDX2 (Fig.4b).
Postoperatively, the patient received three cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve of 5 on day 1 repeated every 21 days) and etoposide (80 mg/m2 on days 1 through 3 repeated every 21 days).
During the first course, grade 4 neutropenia occurred and it was managed with prophylactic fluoroquinolones.
After 4 months, multiple recurrences in the para-aortic lymph nodes were detected, which was pathologically demonstrated via EUS-FNA to be NEC.
The patient underwent second-line chemotherapy with amrubicin (24 mg/m2 on days 1 through 3 repeated every 21 days).
Grade 4 neutropenia and anemia developed during the courses, and she needed to receive pegylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and red blood cell transfusion.
However, she died of progressive disease 8 months after surgery.
"
"A 23-year-old woman with a history of carnitine deficiency presented with exertional dyspnea and fatigue.
She was first diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy at age 10 years, when she presented with symptoms of congestive heart failure and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.
At that time, her total carnitine level was <3 μmol/L (normal range, 25–69 μmol/L), and her free carnitine level was <3 μmol/L (normal range, 16–60 μmol/L).
The cardiomyopathy was attributed to carnitine deficiency.
After 5 months of therapy with carnitine supplements, her total carnitine and free carnitine levels had increased to 86 μmol/L and 48 μmol/L, respectively, and her left ventricular systolic function had normalized, with fractional shortening of 34.7%.
At the current admission, the patient reported that, over the past 10 years, she had only been intermittently compliant with her carnitine supplement regimen, and that, approximately 6 months before presentation, her total carnitine and free carnitine levels had dropped to 18 μmol/L and 17 μmol/L, respectively.
She underwent TTE followed by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with gadolinium enhancement.
The TTE showed normal LV function and mild, concentric LV hypertrophy (Fig.1).
Results of CMR confirmed normal LV size and function but showed focal increased wall thickness at the basal and mid lateral wall (end-diastolic thickness, 1.6 cm) (Fig.2) with patchy delayed gadolinium enhancement (Fig.3).
On the basis of the patient's family history of sudden cardiac death, abnormal myocardial structure, and underlying disease process, a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was placed for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death from both bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias.

"A 34-year-old Hispanic male without significant past medical history presented to our hospital with a one month history of cough; productive of whitish sputum.
At presentation, he denied fever, chills, night sweats, chest pain, hemoptysis, back pain, recent travel or sick contacts.
He reported that he had approximately a 15–20 pound weight loss during the last six months.
He denied smoking, socially drank alcohol, and had unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the past.
On admission, his temperature was 97.9°F; heart rate was 85 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 107/66 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air.
Examination showed oral thrush, decreased breath sounds and crackles on the right lower lung base.
No cutaneous lesions were reported and the rest of clinical examination was unremarkable.
His complete blood count (CBC) showed hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, WBCs 2.3×109/L, and platelets of 164×109/L.
His creatinine was 0.62 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen was 10 mg/dL.
Radiograph of the chest showed extensive right and left perihilar opacity more on the right side, and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a right sided large perihilar mass (Figure 1) with multiple thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, ribs, and sternal tiny lytic lesions consistent with bony metastasis (Figure 2).
Blood and sputum cultures were negative.
Tuberculosis was ruled out by three consecutive negative sputum smears for acid fast bacilli and a negative QUANTIferon gold test.
He tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and his CD4 counts came back at 7 cells/uL.
He was started on prophylaxis with bactrim 80–160 mg daily and azithromycin 1200 mg weekly for opportunistic infections.
Bronchoscopy with biopsy was performed but was unrevealing and he underwent a video assisted mediastinoscopy with biopsies of the right hilar mass.
Pathology showed spindle cells positive for CD34, BCL2, vimentin, and HHV-8 with diffuse positivity for CD31 diagnostic of KS.
He started treatment with HAART in the form of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 200/300 mg and dolutegravir 50 mg.
The patient was actively involved in decisions regarding management options.
He favored HAART isolated regimen without additional chemotherapy.
His condition showed continuing clinical improvement; a repeat CT scan of the chest at three months showed profound regression of the disease with disappearance of most of the lesions (Figure 3).
"
"A 52-year-old man (body surface area: 1.3 m2) known to have dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), was admitted for worsening heart failure (NYHA class IV).
He presented with a 5-month history of cough, progressive dyspnoea, orthopnea and recurrent upper abdominal pain started from 2 months ago.
On examination his vital signs were body temperature 37°C, blood pressure 80/40 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, and electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with heart rate 50 beats per minute.
Physical examination revealed the jugular venous distension, significant tender hepatomegaly and bilateral pitting edema at lower limbs.
Laboratory tests showed elevated pro-NT brain natriuretic peptide of 22145 pg/ml (normal 0 to 227 pg/ml) and unremarkable D-dimer.
X-ray and computed tomography of the chest demonstrated consolidation of bilateral lower lobes with pleural effusion, while his venous Doppler of lower extremities was normal.
Based on his clinical condition, echocardiography was immediately inserted.
There were severe dilated cardiac chambers, especially enlargement of the left ventricle (LV) (58 mm/m2) with spherical shape, decreased wall thickness, impaired ejection fraction 22% and severe mitral regurgitation on two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2DTTE).
Parasternal short axis and subxyphoid view (Figure ​1) showed the mobile right atrial mass highly suspicious of a thrombus traversing the right atrial cavity during the cardiac cycle accompanying with free-floating small parts of the thrombi.
Real-time three dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (RT-3DTTE) was performed to further confirm the nature of mass.
It showed a highly mobile thrombus, irregular in contour, measured 2.6 × 1.0 cm which floating around the orifice of inferior vena cava and protruding into the right atrial cavity (Figure ​2).
In addition, RT-3DTTE evaluated right ventricle (RV) systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction 15.7% (Figure ​3).
He was maintained on digoxin, spironolactone, furosemide, sotalol and dopamine.
At the same time therapeutic anticoagulation was started with low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin.
The patient had an uneventful hospital course and one week follow-up echocardiography confirmed adequate removal of the thrombus (Figures 4A and ​4B).
"
"A 70–year–old female presented to the Emergency Department with palpitations, dyspnea and anterior epistaxis.
She had a 3 years history of atrial fibrillation and chronic heart failure NYHA class III.
She was treated with aspirin 100 mg/day.
Physical examination revealed an irregular pulse of 148 beats/min, blood pressure of 130/100 mmHg, pansystolic mitral murmur of 2/6 grade, murmur of tricuspid regurgitation of 3/6 grade, lower extremities swelling.
The oto-rhino-laryngology exam conclusion was of anterior epistaxis.
The 12–lead electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, inferior ischemia.
Her International Normalized Ratio (INR) was of 1,24.
The two–dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the thickening of the mitral valves with a moderate mitral insufficiency and a mobile round mass in the left atrium, heterogeneous, inhomogeneous, of 18 mm in size, attached with a narrow stalk to the interatrial septum.
It showed a tumor–like movement with a cardiac cycle, reaching the mitral annular plane (Figure 1,Figure 2).
Also, echocardiography showed tricuspid insufficiency with a maximum gradient of 30 mmHg, intact interatrial septum, akinesia of two thirds of basal inferior wall, ejection fraction of 42%.
There was no mass in the left atrial appendage.
The two–dimensional transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the presence of the intraatrial mass.
Epistaxis was considered to be due to heart failure and the increased venous pressure.
The patient was referred to the cardiovascular surgery clinic, but she refused surgery.
Anticoagulation with fraxiparine of 0,6 ml/day was started and continued for 3 weeks, after cessation of epistaxis by nasal tamponament.
After 3 weeks the echocardiography was repeated, with no remnant mass in the left atrium.
The conclusion was that the mass must have been a thrombus that has melted away.
In this particular case, the left intraatrial thrombus may have been due to the presence of atrial fibrillation.
"
"A 48-year-old man presented at our hospital complaining of intracranial bruits.
The cranial nerve and laboratory examinations were normal.
A DVAF was considered, conventional digital subtraction angiography was performed, which showed a Cognard II DVAF in the location of right hypoglossal canal (HC).
The DVAF was fed by the meningeal branches of the bilateral ascending pharyngeal arteries, and the right anterior condylar veins within the hypoglossal canal that was the fistulous point mainly drained into the jugular vein.
Endovascular treatment was insisted upon by the patient because of the associated intolerable intracranial bruit.
Treatment was performed by transarterial approach under general anesthesia using a biplane angiographic unit.
Standard coaxial techniques were used.
The guide catheter was navigated into the left ascendingtrawt pharyngeal artery.
Marathon flow directed catheter (eV3) was subsequently navigated over a Mirage.008 microwire (eV3) to reach as near as possible to the fistula.
The microcatheter was flushed with 10 mL of normal saline.
The dead space of the microcatheter was subsequently filled with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Onyx-18 was then injected over two minutes to fill the microcatheter and to replace the DMSO in the dead space.
The injection was stopped until unwanted flow into branches of the right ascending pharyngeal artery was observed.
The follow-up angiogram showed no residual shunt (Figure ​1).
The intracranial bruits disappeared immediately after the operation.
For the toxicity of DMSO, 10 mg dexamethasone was intravenously injected for three days.
On the second day after endovascular treatment, the patient complainted of difficulty moving his tongue to the left.
Cranial nerve examination was only significant for a right hypoglossal nerve palsy.
The patient was discharged from our hospital four days after treatment without continuative pharmacotherapy.
At two months follow-up, the patient's main complaint were difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and slurred speech (dysarthria).
In addition, his tongue deviated toward the right during tongue protrusion, and marked right-sided hemiatrophy was observed (Figure ​2).
The cranial nerve examation showed right hypoglossal nerve palsy persisted.
We telephone the patient at three months follow-up and requested a vocal cord evaluation by an ENT specialist in a local hospital.
Vocal cord paralysis was not found, and there was no evidence of vagus nerve dysfunction.
Oral Vitamin B12 was used and his prognosis was still at a long follow-up.
"
"A 40-year-old woman visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in our hospital because of a complaint of sudden dyspnea on effort.
She was previously diagnosed with endometriosis and prescribed a combination oral contraceptive pill (drospirenone/ethinylestradiol betadex, trade name; Yaz™, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany).
Following the Kumamoto Earthquakes and subsequent aftershocks in April 2016, she spent 7 nights in a vehicle.
She noticed sudden dyspnea on effort when she walked outside the car on the 8th morning after the first earthquake.
Although she walked around for personal reasons during the daytime, she spent nights in her small car with her legs in a hanging position.
She noticed swelling and pain in her left lower extremity, and her serum D-dimer levels were 13.2 μg/mL.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was suspected by her home doctor.
A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT)-scan revealed a contrast deficit in the bilateral pulmonary artery (Fig.2A) and in the left lower extremity (posterior tibial, soleus and gastrocnemius vein) (Fig.2B).
Her right ventricular function was intact (estimated pulmonary artery pressure=29/8 mmHg in cardiac ultrasound).
Her plasma brain natriuretic peptide and high-sense troponin T concentration levels were 97.2 pg/mL and 0.0061 ng/mL, respectively.
She was diagnosed with PTE and admitted to our department.
On admission, her blood pressure was 129/80 mmHg and her heart rate was 72 beats per minute.
Her degree of oxygen saturation (SaO2) in arterial blood gas was 97.7%.
Her body mass index was 24.4 kg/m2.
Electrocardiography and cardiac ultrasound did not indicate heart failure.
An investigation of most factors related to thrombus formation (including protein C, protein S, antithrombin, and antiphospholipid antibodies) revealed that all such factors were normal.
The discontinuation of the oral contraceptive and the administration of rivaroxaban (30 mg, daily), a direct oral anticoagulant (trade name: Xarelto™, Bayer) was initiated according to the results of the EINSTEIN-PE trial (3).
After 7 days, a follow-up contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a reduction in the thrombosis (Fig.3).
The patient was followed up with rivaroxaban.
The patient gave her consent for the publication of this study.

"The proband is a 19-year-old woman, first child of healthy unrelated parents.
Her family history was unremarkable.
She was born at term after a normal pregnancy.
The perinatal period was uneventful and her early development was referred to as normal, but after 1 year of age, psychomotor delay became evident.
She started walking autonomously at 22 months, with poor balance and frequent falls.
At 3 years of age, she developed a demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy and a brain MRI disclosed supratentorial leukodystrophy.
During her childhood, the clinical signs remained stable.
At 10 years, her walking difficulties worsened, and limb weakness and tremor ensued.
The neurological evaluation showed dysarthria, dysmetria, ataxic gait and hyporeflexia in the four limbs with muscle wasting.
She was able to walk alone only for a few steps with an ataxic gait.
Mild cognitive impairment was documented (IQ 75, WISC-R scale).
Histological analysis of a muscle biopsy showed hypo/atrophy of fibres.
The clinical evolution was slowly progressive.
At her last follow-up examination, at 19 years of age, she was able to walk alone only with ankle-foot orthotic aids and had developed a marked dorsal-lumbar scoliosis.
Other clinical signs were stable.
Neurophysiological studies confirmed worsening of her mixed axonal demyelinating peripheral neuropathy.
Brain and spinal cord MRI showed mild extension of signal abnormalities and extensive cavitations in the cerebral white matter; the cerebellum and brainstem were spared but the spinal cord was thin with no obvious focal lesions (figure 1A).
Plasma lactate was 2.9 mM (n.v. <2.1).
"
"A 76-year old woman presented with a 24-month history of enlarging mass involving the back history of trauma.
Physical examination showed a mass of an 3x4 cm in diameter, localized in the right inter-scapular region.
The mass was ulcerative helophytic, grayish in colour, hard in consistency and easily bleeding on manipulation.
The remainder of the examination was unremarkable; no lymphadenopathy and no abdominal masses were felt.
After resection, the histological examinations of the specimens have concluded for basal cell carcinoma.
A local recurrence was observed 18 months later; the patient was admitted to our institution for Lumpectomy (Figure 1).
Histopathological examination revealed a syringomatous pattern infiltrating the dermis (Figure 2, Figure 3), subcutis and skeletal muscle.
The neoplastic epithelial cells were arranged in interconnecting cords with microcystic areas.
Nests, cords, and tubules of the tumour extended into the dermis and into the adjacent muscle.
Many lobules showed squamous differentiation.
Sclerosis of stroma around the cords was present.
Tumour cells were not connected to the epidermis.
The immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for anti-CK7 (Figure 4), AE1/AE3 and negativity for anti CEA and anti CK20.
Based upon her histological and immunohistochemical presentation, the diagnosis of syringomatous eccrine carcinoma was established.
Radiotherapy of the involved area was performed (70 Gy, 35 sessions)
"
"A 72-year-old woman underwent RF ablation for the treatment of a metachronous solitary liver metastasis from rectal adenocarcinoma, which had been treated 18 mo before with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and anterior resection.
The lesion was located in segment VIII.
The procedure went well and the patient was initially haemodynamically stable.
One hour later her condition suddenly worsened.
She was clinically dizzy and had fatigue and pallor.
We detected hypotension and tachycardia.
Emergency blood tests showed a haemoglobin level of < 7 g/dL and markedly elevated transaminase levels.
A computed tomography examination revealed an accumulation of intraperitoneal fluid in the pelvis and two liver haematomas.
The images showed two liver lacerations, one following the path of the needle (Figure ​(Figure1A1A-​-C)C) and another, unexplained laceration leading away from the first (Figure ​(Figure2).2).
The patient had no serious coughing or hiccupping after the RF treatment, or any other complications that might have caused increased abdominal pressure and tumour rupture.
Subsequently, the patient received a blood transfusion and close monitoring.
She was haemodynamically stable after the second blood transfusion and completely recovered 24 h later.
The patient remained in bed for 1 wk.
No surgical intervention was required.
"
"A 5-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Children’s Emergency Department with epistaxis, bleeding from the dental extraction site and a widespread purpuric rash, secondary to acute idiopathic thrombocytopenia.
Two days prior to this, he developed a generalised chickenpox rash.
While in the department it was noted that his heart rate ranged between 50 and 60 beats per min, he was otherwise haemo-dynamically stable with a normal blood pressure and oxygen saturations in air.
He had a short systolic murmur grade 2/6 at the left sternal border.
He had no clinical evidence of myocarditis or heart failure.
He had extensive generalised petechiae and purpuric rash (figure 1) secondary to acute thrombocytopenia presumed to be due to varicella infection.
Apparently he was healthy prior to this admission.
There was no history of maternal lupus.
An ECG was performed which showed complete heart block (figure 2).
He was admitted to the high dependency unit for close overnight monitoring.
The presumed diagnosis was complete heart block secondary to varicella infection.1 2 The initial investigation showed normal electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, glucose and magnesium levels.
The full blood count showed a normal haemoglobin and white cell count.
But the platelet count was low that is, 13×109/l.
The platelet count normalised within 10 days without any intervention.
The antinuclear antibody titres and the autoimmune screen were negative.
Maternal autoimmune screen was negative.
The echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart and follow-up 24 h tape showed persistence of complete heart block.
Following these investigations a diagnosis of congenital complete heart block was made.
On follow-up after 6 months his heart rate remains between 50 and 60 beats per min, but he remains asymptomatic without any intervention.
The need for a pacemaker is being considered on follow-up.
The incidental finding of complete heart block was congenital in aetiology with no association with varicella infection or acute thrombocytopenia.
This case highlights that asymptomatic late-presenting congenital complete heart block must be considered as a differential diagnosis in children presenting with asymptomatic bradycardia to the emergency department.
"
"A 29-year-old primipara presented with complaints of persistent, severe right -sided upper abdominal pain during deep inspiration, physical exercise and on local pressure.
These complaints had developed gradually after giving birth one year earlier.
This pregnancy had been complicated by HELLP syndrome with a subcapsular liver hematoma sized 20 cm × 5 cm, which had resolved spontaneously.
At current presentation, liver function tests were normal.
She assured having never experienced signs suggestive of sexually transmitted diseases or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
She had never undergone intra-abdominal interventions.
An upper-abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a density between liver and diaphragm at the site of the former subcapsular hematoma, suspect of perihepatic adhesions (Figure ​1).
She was referred to the hepatobiliary surgeon, who performed a laparoscopy and confirmed the presence of a thick adhesion between liver segment V/VIII and the diaphragm (Figure ​2).
Adhesiolysis was performed in the same session by monopolar diathermia and sharp dissection, followed by the instillation of 1.5 L Adept (4% icodextrin solution) into the peritoneal cavity to prevent the formation of new adhesions.
On follow-up until three years post-surgery, she was free of symptoms.

"This is a 53-year-old male patient who went to our hospital with chief complaint of massive gum bleeding for 1 day.
The patient had a history of chronic hepatitis C.
PEG-IFN-α-2a (180 μg) plus ribavirin (1200 mg/day) were prescribed to the patient since March 17, 2014.
He denied any autoimmune conditions before treatment.
The baseline virological data revealed high virus load (HCV RNA 2.1 × 106 IU/mL) with genotype 1b.
Rapid virological response was not achieved at the fourth week (HCV RNA: 2.12 × 106 IU/mL).
Partial early virological response (HCV RNA: 103 IU/mL at week 12) and delayed virological response (HCV RNA: <15 IU/mL at Week 24) were noted.
However, fatigue, anemia, and depression syndrome were progressed at 30th week.
The patient requested to stop treatment at Week 36.
The viral load at the end-of-treatment (EOT) was undetectable.
The platelet count at EOT was 92 × 103 cells/μL and elevated to 159 × 103 cells/μL 1 week later.
Two weeks following EOT, the patient developed massive gum bleeding.
The physical examination showed the multiple petechiae on the extremities.
There is no sign of intracerebral hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, or other internal bleeding.
The initial platelet count was 4 × 103cells/μL.
Coagulation profile showed normal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, d-dimer, and fibrin degradation product.
Peripheral blood smear showed neither fragmented red blood cells, helmet cells nor abnormal platelet aggregation.
Concomitant autoimmune connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or cryoglobulinemia were excluded due to negative anti-nuclear antibody and cryoglobulin except for positive anti-cardiolipin IgG (116 GPL, normal range <20 GPL) and anti-phospholipid IgG (165 U, normal range <15 U).
Anti-phospholipid syndrome was excluded due to no previous thromboembolic events, according to 2006 Sapporo criteria.12 Bone marrow biopsy was also performed, which revealed hypocellular marrow with even cellular distribution and without evidence of lymphoid neoplasia.
The potential drugs that may cause platelet lysis were ruled out.
Blood transfusion of platelet was performed, but poor response with rapid decline of platelet count in the next day of transfusion.
A diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura was made.
We started intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (40 mg, 3 times daily) on November 27 combined with platelet transfusion treatments.
It still showed no significant improvement.
Azathioprine (100 mg, oral, once daily) was added since December 3.
Hydroxychloroquine (400 mg, oral, once daily) was also prescribed due to positive anti-phospholipid antibodies.
Platelet count gradually increased to 93 × 103 cells/μL 17 days after admission, so methylprednisolone was changed to oral form and slowly tapered off.
On December 15, the patient was discharged due to stable condition with platelet counts elevating to 117 × 103 cells/μL (Figure ​1).
Followed laboratory data after 5 months revealed sustained virologic response, platelet count above 150 × 103 cells/μL, and decreased anti-cardiolipin IgG (30.5GPL) and anti-phospholipid IgG (73.21 U) levels.

"A 28-year-old African American woman presented to the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Maryland, for evaluation of right-sided paralysis and left-sided paresthesias after being found down in her home between her nightstand and her bed.
The symptoms began after eating at a local restaurant chain, consuming alcohol, and smoking one cigarette dipped in liquid phencyclidine (PCP).
She was asymptomatic that night and went to bed without complications.
She was found down next to the bed the following morning unable to move.
The patient denied any physical trauma other than falling from the bed.
She had no history of seizures, sickle cell anemia, fever, urinary or bowel incontinence, or pain.
The patient had a history of viral meningitis without residual deficits eight years prior, gastric bypass surgery, and cholecystectomy, and she was treated for a presumed urinary tract infection five days prior to admission at an outside institution.
Her triage vital signs were as follows: temperature 36.8°C, blood pressure 155/100 mm Hg, heart rate 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on room air.
On physical exam, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, and time.
Her cranial nerves II–XII were grossly intact.
She had 2/5 strength in her right lower extremity, 3/5 in her left lower extremity, and 4/5 bilaterally in her upper extremities.
Her sensation was intact.
She opened her eyes spontaneously, her verbal response was oriented and appropriate, and she obeyed commands, resulting in a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
She had tenderness to palpation over the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without obvious external signs of trauma.
Her anal sphincter tone was intact.
Multiple laboratory abnormalities were noted on admission, including hyperlactemia, elevated liver function tests, and electrolyte derangements.
Her complete blood count and remainder of her complete metabolic panel were within normal limits.
These values are summarized along with reference ranges in Table 1.
Her toxicology screen was positive for PCP.
Blood cultures drawn on admission grew the aerobic bacteria Salmonella enterica serotype 4,12: i, and then repeat cultures drawn two days later grew group B streptococcus (aerobic and non-aerobic).
Subsequent blood cultures were negative, as were stool cultures.
Metronidazole and vancomycin therapy was initiated empirically, with transition to ceftriaxone upon learning of the culture results.
In addition, she had a detailed autoimmunity workup including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and HLA-B27, all of which returned within normal limits.
Admission computerized tomography scan of her cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine revealed no spinal fractures.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no acute intracranial abnormalities, but enhancement within the central aspect of C3–T2 suggested spinal cord edema, disc protrusions at C3–4, C4–5, and C5–6, and bilateral posterior neck muscle edema.
A lumbar puncture was not initially performed upon patient admission due to concerns about raised intracranial pressure from suspected trauma.
Four hours after presentation, her strength had progressively deteriorated to 1/5 in all extremities.
She lost proprioception in her toes bilaterally and developed absent anal sphincter tone.
The patient was admitted to the neurotrauma intensive care unit with further deterioration ultimately requiring endotracheal intubation due to respiratory failure.
Upon her positive blood culture results, lumbar puncture was performed, which demonstrated a pattern consistent with ATM, the results of which are summarized in Table 2.
An extensive workup for infectious etiologies was also completed, with the results summarized in Table 3.
Plasma exchange therapy was initiated with a suspected diagnosis of ATM.
Despite maximal medical therapy, the patient remains quadriplegic, is experiencing neurologic pain, received a tracheostomy due to prolonged respiratory failure, and required a feeding jejunostomy tube placement at the time of this report.
"
"A 18-year-old man presented with a history of a palpable lump in the presternal area, which was found incidentally after weight reduction.
The patient had no other relevant medical or trauma history.
On physical examination, the lesion was found to be a nonmovable, firm mass with no tenderness or associated skin changes, detected at the midline position over the sternum (at the manubrium level).
There was no visible fistulous opening or discharge from the lesion.
On ultrasonography, we detected a well-circumscribed, oval, anechoic mass, with posterior acoustic enhancement, that measured about 3.3 × 1.7 × 3.1 cm, and was located in the subcutaneous fat layer over the sternum.
In the dependent portion of the mass was an internal, well-circumscribed, heterogeneously hypoechoic, egg-shaped lesion (Fig.1A and B) showing a movement according to patient movement.
The mass could be compressed using the linear transducer (Fig.2A and B).
A color Doppler study showed no vascularity within the cystic mass or the internal hypoechoic lesion (Fig.1C).
Surgical excision of the mass was performed without postoperative complications.
Grossly, the excised mass was a well-defined, ovoid, cystic mass gray-tan in color.
On section, it was found to be a unilocular cyst filled with whitish mucous material.
Microscopically, the mass was lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium suggestive of respiratory type-mucosa (Fig.3).
There was nonspecific collagenous fibrosis around the cyst.
The differential diagnosis of subcutaneous cyst included epidermal inclusion cyst, thyroglossal duct cyst, branchial cleft cyst, and dermoid cyst.
There was no histological evidence of squamous epithelium, keratin, thyroid tissue, or skin appendage in the cystic wall of the present case.
The mass was diagnosed as a bronchogenic cyst.
"
"A 26-year-old woman was seen in the emergency department (ED) for chest pain and hypertension.
She was found to have a urinary tract infection and was sent home with an antibiotic and thiazide diuretic.
Two days later, she returned with epigastric pain, nausea, emesis and myalgias.
The patient had no significant medical history and denied cardio-respiratory symptoms; however, she complained of a low exercise tolerance for the last year.
There was no family history of cardiac or pulmonary disease or of sudden cardiac death.
She was born in the USA and had neither travelled recently nor had any sick contacts.
On examination, she was hypertensive (170/105 mm Hg), tachycardic (125 bpm), had dry mucous membranes and appeared ill looking.
She was found to have an elevated serum creatinine of 160 μmol/l (normal 60–110 μmol/l).
After receiving 1.5 l of intravenous fluids for presumed volume depletion and prerenal azotaemia she became short of breath.
Crackles were noted on auscultation of her chest and a portable chest film demonstrated hazy infiltrates that likely represented pulmonary oedema.
She then developed hypotension with systolic pressures in the 90s.
Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation was initiated.
An ECG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a rate of 130 bpm and minimal ST depression on the precordial leads.
In consultation with a cardiologist, the patient received 40 mg of intravenous furosemide.
An echocardiogram demonstrated global hypokinesis with a left-ventricular ejection fraction <10% (see figure 1).
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where she became more anxious and tachycardic to 170 bpm.
She was intubated and sedated.
Despite the placement of a Foley catheter and administration of intravenous loop diuretics, she remained anuric for the first 12 h of hospitalisation.
She developed signs of acute kidney injury with a creatinine that increased to 350 μmol/l within the first 24 h of hospitalisation.
She received norepinephrine and milrinone to improve cardiac output.
On the second day of hospitalisation, she was evaluated by a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon for emergent circulatory support as she had developed signs of poor tissue perfusion with a lactic acidosis (8.4 mmol/l; normal <2.2 mmol/l) and transaminitis with aspartate aminotransferase/alanine transaminase  >150 IU/l (normal <40 U/l).
She was taken to the cardiac catheterisation laboratory for emergent right heart catheterisation and biopsy to exclude acute myocarditis.
Over the next few days, she was gently fluid resuscitated (guided by bioreactance non-invasive cardiac output), the pressors were gradually weaned off and she became non-oliguric.
She slowly regained renal function and organ perfusion improved with resolution of the lactic acidosis and a decrease in liver transaminases.
On hospital day 5 she was transferred to the medical ward and was eventually discharged home on non-selective β blockade, an ACE inhibitor and nitrate with planned follow-up at the heart-failure clinic.
The patient returned to the ED 4 days later with an elevated blood pressure, nausea and abdominal pain.
A contrast scan of her abdomen revealed pancreatitis and an adrenal mass.
During her treatment for pancreatitis she began to have paroxysms of headaches, nausea, emesis and abdominal pain with corresponding hypertension to the 220s systolic and tachycardia to 120s with a baseline systolic pressure of 90–110 mm Hg (see figure 2).
Her urinary and plasma catecholamines were elevated and confirmed on repeat testing.
She was given aggressive fluid rehydration and α and β blockade for a planned adrenalectomy.
Prior to surgery her left-ventricular ejection fraction had improved to 55% on medical management (see figure 1).
Pathology of her adrenal gland was consistent with a non-malignant pheochromocytoma (see figure 3).

"An 8-year-old boy was referred for evaluation of fatigue.
He was born at term weighing 4 kg to non-consanguineous parents and attained normal early developmental milestones.
Height and weight were on the 10th and 50th centiles, respectively.
Preliminary examination was remarkable only for hepatomegaly extending 3.5 cm below the right costal margin.
Initial laboratory evaluation revealed normochromic normocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 7.8 g/dL (11.5–16), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 85.8 fL (75–87) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) 25.4 pg (25–35)) with marked anisocytosis (red-cell distribution width (RDW) 29% (11–14.5)).
Hypochromia and teardrops were evident on a blood film.
Leucopoenia was also a feature (white cell count 2.9×109/L (4.5–13.5), neutrophils 1.7×109/L (2–7.5) and lymphocytes 0.8×109/L (1.5–4)).
A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow with erythroid hyperplasia.
An iron stain revealed that approximately 50% of erythroblasts were ringed sideroblasts.
Marrow cytogenetics were normal including fluorescence in situ hybridisation studies of chromosomes 5q, 7 and 8 and flow cytometry did not detect a blast population.
Serum copper and lead were normal, as were blood smears on the proband’s parents and sister.
Analysis of several genes responsible for hereditary SA (ALAS2, ABC7, FECH and PUS1) revealed no reported pathogenic variants.
Fasting lactate was elevated at 3.8 mmol/L.
Neurological examination identified upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs bilaterally; however, cerebellar signs were negative.
MRI of the brain demonstrated volume loss with slight prominence of the cerebellar folia.
Urine organic acids revealed elevated 3-methylglutaconate and 3-methylglutarate.
The lactate:pyruvate ratio was elevated (30:1).
Muscle biopsy revealed a structurally normal muscle and biochemical assay of respiratory chain components resulted in a diagnosis of partial complex IV deficiency.
He subsequently commenced a high-fat diet and coenzyme Q with a resultant improvement in energy.
Analysis of mtDNA in leucocytes and muscle utilising PCR did not reveal a deletion.
Carnitine, vitamin A, thiamine, pyridoxine, folate and uridine were supplemented without improvement in his anaemia.
Haemoglobin levels fell to 4.4 g/dL, leading to occasional and then regular three-weekly red cell transfusions.
With repeated transfusions, ferritin rose to 1700 µg/L, necessitating iron chelation.
Peak growth hormone and cortisol to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia were 30.9 mU/L (normal >20) and 447 nmol/L (normal >500), respectively, at age 13 years.
Thyroid function was normal.
Repeat peak cortisol was 384 nmol/L following adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation.
Plasma renin activity was elevated to 15 ng/mL/h, and adrenal androgens were below the lower limit of assay detection.
A urinary steroid profile was qualitatively normal, as was an abdominal ultrasound.
Hydrocortisone 5 mg twice daily and fludrocortisone 100 µg daily were initiated.
Adrenal autoantibodies to 21-hydroxylase were negative and very-long-chain fatty acids were normal.
The patient has recently developed a renal tubular Fanconi syndrome including glycosuria, hypokalaemia, hypophosphataemia with low maximal tubular reabsorption of phosphate and a generalised aminoaciduria.
In addition, he was incidentally noted to have hyperglycaemia during an admission for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion.
Glycated haemoglobin was elevated to 62 mmol/mol (7.8%) despite rapid red cell turnover.
Pancreatic autoantibodies were negative (glutamic acid decarboxylase, anti-insulin, anti-islet antigen 2 and pancreatic islet cell antibodies).
He is maintained on twice daily insulin detemir with satisfactory glycaemic control with fructosamine 161 µmol/L (205–285).

"A 39-year-old Korean male come to our hospital complaining of cough, myalgia, and fever that had lasted for 5 days.
He was a company worker and denied any previous medical histories.
He was a current smoker and drank alcohol about once a month.
His vital signs were: blood pressure, 100/60 mmHg, heart rate, 100/min, respiratory rate, 25 breaths/min, and body temperature, 39 °C.
On the physical examination, decreased breathing sound was noted in the right lower lung.
Laboratory tests revealed a c-reactive protein (CRP) level of 119 mg/dL, a total bilirubin level of 1.8 mg/dL, and alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels of 250 and 172 IU/L, respectively.
His platelet count was 98,000/mm3, while his white cell count was 8150/mm3 (neutrophil: 85%).
In the arterial blood gas analysis checked in room air, pH, PaCO2, PaO2, bicarbonate, and oxygen saturation levels were 7.50, 34 mmHg, 67 mmHg, 26.5 mmol/L, and 95%, respectively.
A test for the human immunodeficiency virus was negative.
Mycoplasma and Chlamydia antibodies were negative.
Streptococcal and Legionella urinary antigens were negative.
Anti-nuclear and anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies were also negative.
A chest X-ray showed consolidation in the right mid to lower lung fields.
Chest computed tomography showed consolidation with surrounding ground glass opacity in the right middle lobe with a small amount of pleural effusion in the right hemithorax (Fig.1).
Abdominal sonography revealed no abnormal finding in the hepatobiliary system.
We began to administer 4 L/min of oxygen nasally and empirical antibiotics with third generation cephalosporin and macrolide following a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia.
On the second day in the hospital, the patient’s fever was sustained and he complained of dyspnea.
His hypoxemia was aggravated such that he required 7 L/min of oxygen via a simple mask and the consolidation and pleural effusion had markedly progressed (Fig.2a).
We performed bronchoscopy and thoracentesis.
Multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for respiratory viruses using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive for human adenovirus while other microbiological studies were negative.
Pleural fluid was lymphocyte-dominant exudate and was also positive for human adenovirus.
Under the diagnosis of adenovirus pneumonia, we started antiviral therapy with oral ribavirin 400 mg q 12 h while maintaining antibiotics.
On hospital day 4, his fever had subsided and symptoms were much improved.
The transaminase levels, CRP and platelet counts gradually normalized (Fig.3).
A follow-up chest X-ray was clear (Fig.2b) and he was discharged in hospital day 13 without any complications.

"On December 28, 2014, a 70-year-old man complaining of abdominal pain, dizziness, and nausea was referred to the Hebei General Hospital, Hebei, China.
Gastroscopy showed irregular hemorrhagic ulcerative lesions extending from the gastric body to the lesser curvature and pyloric stenosis of the stomach.
Gastric biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
On January 7, 2015, palliative gastrectomy plus Roux-en-Y near esophagojejunostomy were performed.
Diffuse enlarged para-aortic and anterior superior pancreatic lymph nodes, as well as lymph nodes around the common hepatic artery, could not be resected.
Postoperative pathology demonstrated moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma (Fig.1A).
Immunohistochemistry showed the following: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) (+), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (+), CD31 (+), CD105 (+) (Fig.1B–E), triple positive (TP) (+), glutathione S-transferase π (GST-π) (+++), topoisomerase enzyme II α (TOPOII α), P53 (–), and Ki-67 (70%).
The diagnosis was stage IV gastric adenocarcinoma with multiple lymphnodes metastases (T4N2M1).
The patient was administered 1 cycle of chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and S-1; however, the treatment was terminated, as the patient could not tolerate the associated gastrointestinal disturbances.
On February 2, 2015, adjuvant radiotherapy was administered.
Before radiotherapy, positron-emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) showed extensive distant metastasis (left supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph nodes, and lymph nodes throughout the abdominal cavity).
The patient's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was 2, and his body mass index (BMI) was 19; therefore, he was considered to be at risk of malnutrition.
Oral apatinib 850 mg once a day combined with and following radiotherapy was prescribed.
Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to treatment.
In an attempt to improve tolerance to treatment, palliative intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was used.
The patient received a dose of 64 Gy in 30 fractions to the mediastinum and doses of 52 Gy in 26 fractions to the other abdominal metastatic lesions (n = 5).
The left supraclavicular lymph node was treated with apatinib alone (Figs.2 and 3A–C).
A PET-CT scan performed 2 weeks after radiotherapy showed an 80% reduction in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 2-deoxy-2-[[18]F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG).
FDG uptake was higher in the left supraclavicular lymph node compared to the metastatic regions treated with concurrent apatinib and radiation therapy.
According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the clinical effect was partial response (Fig.2).
The patient received further radiotherapy (66 Gy in 28 fractions) to the left supraclavicular lymph node due to residual metastasis.
Tumor markers and biochemical analyses were evaluated every 2 months.
Two months after therapy, chest, and abdominal CT scans indicated stable disease; anemia and gastrointestinal symptoms had improved, ECOG performance status was 0, and BMI was 22.
Hematologic toxicity, hypertension, renal dysfunction, proteinuria, and hand–foot syndrome were not observed during apatinib therapy.
In September 2015, a follow-up examination showed increased carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125 and ferritin; however, gastroscopy and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities.
In November 2015, the patient had difficulty swallowing and experienced intermittent hematochezia.
Apatinib was terminated due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
Gastroscopy revealed anastomotic stenosis due to gastric cancer and intragastric hemorrhage (Fig.3D–F).
The patient and his family refused chemoradiotherapy.
Symptomatic treatment with a hemostatic drug and best supportive care were prescribed.
After 1 week of therapy, hemorrhaging was resolved.
One month later, the patient again experienced intermittent hematochezia.
On December 20, 2015, PET-CT demonstrated extensive metastasis.
The patient and his family requested best supportive care.
On April 16, 2016, the patient died due to pulmonary infection.

"We present the case of a 16-year-old girl, admitted to our clinic with severe abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.
The anamnesis revealed that the girl comes from a family of potters, and that she also participated in the process of pottery, her father being diagnosed with lead poisoning 2 years before.
The patient's personal history underlined that approximately 1 year ago she presented with severe abdominal pain, being diagnosed with acute appendicitis and she underwent appendectomy, but the pain persisted, thus due to family history of lead poisoning, the suspicion of saturnine colic rose, and she was diagnosed with lead poisoning (urinary lead: 219 μg/L), but she received only symptomatic treatment.
Approximately 3 weeks before admission to our clinic, she was admitted to the regional hospital with another episode of saturnine colic (blood lead: 113.2 μg/dL), and chelation therapy with EDTA (4 days before the admission in our clinic) was initiated, with a dose of 2 tablets daily, one in the morning and one in the evening associated with calcium supplements.
The clinical examination performed at the time of admission revealed the following pathological elements: influenced general status, ailing face, jaundice of the sclera, blue pigmentation of the nails, painful abdomen at palpation, and weight: 45 kg.
The laboratory test performed upon admission revealed hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin (Hb): 10.9 g/dl, hematocrit (Htc): 31.6%, medium cellular volume (MCV): 77.6 fL), increased level of liver transaminases (alanine-aminotransferase (ALAT): 158.9 U/L, aspartate-aminotransferase (ASAT): 63 U/L, gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT): 128 U/L), conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (direct bilirubin (DBi): 1.432 mg/dL), hyponatremia (Na: 132 mmol/L), and hypopotassemia (K: 2.85 mmol/L).
The systolic arterial pressure was 156 mm Hg, and the diastolic was 96 mm Hg.
The blood lead level was 66.28 μg/dL, the urinary one was 419.7 μg/L (normal <50 μg/L) and the value of delta-aminolevulinic acid was 7.66 mg/L (normal <4.5 mg/L).
We also performed abdominal ultrasound which revealed a disappearance of the delimitation between the cortical and medullar parts in both kidneys.
We requested consultation from an occupational healthcare specialist, who recommended the continuation of chelation therapy with EDTA, increasing the dose at 4 tablets/day.
We also required a neurological consultation, and the specialist established the diagnosis of behavioral disorders with depressive elements, and recommended psychotherapy.
Based on all these clinical and laboratory findings, we established the diagnosis of lead poisoning.
We initiated an intense i.v. hydration in order to favor lead elimination, approximately 3 liters per 24 hours initially, and we decreased progressively the quantity once she ceased to vomit, and she was able to consume liquids.
We associated diuretics, initially furosemide by vein, but the values of the arterial pressure persisted above the upper limit, therefore we were forced to introduce also an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, with the remission of arterial hypertension.
Regarding the liver function, we administered amino acids intravenously, associated with liver protectors by mouth.
We also administered vitamins of the B complex in order to improve the neurological impairment.
The evolution was slightly favorable, in the first 3 days after the admission, the patient continued to present severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and she also complained of pain in the lumbar area.
All the laboratory parameters presented normalization of the values after approximately 10 days of treatment.
On the 6th day of admission, we ceased the chelation therapy with EDTA.
We also repeated the blood and urinary lead levels.
The blood level was 45.57 μg/dL, and the urinary one was 836.4 μg/L before discharging the patient.
The abdominal ultrasound reevaluation revealed no pathological modifications.
After 14 days of admission, the patient was discharged without any complaints, and we recommended no further exposure to lead, avoiding the contact and the working in the pottery process.
The long-term outcome of this case depends on further exposure to this heavy metal.
Nevertheless, we intend to repeat the blood lead levels after 12 and 24 months, assessing also the renal (urea, creatinine, urinary exam) and hepatic functions (ASAT, ALAT, GGT, bilirubin).

"A 69-year-old male diabetic patient was admitted with acute left ventricular (LV) failure and was treated with intensive decongestive therapy.
He had severe peripheral edema and bilateral basal crepitations.
Initial workup revealed normal levels of troponine (<0.01 ng/ml) and CPK-MB (4.6 ng/ml), thereby ruling out acute coronary syndrome.
The level of BNP was 1230 pg/ml confirming the diagnosis of heart failure.
Echocardiographic assessment revealed LVEF of 10% with dilated cardiac chambers, and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was 70 mm of Hg with features of raised LV diastolic pressure.
Angiography was performed after 3 days of decongestive therapy which revealed critical triple vessel disease with left main coronary artery disease (Fig.1).
He was referred for CABG.
The patient was put on frusemide infusion with oral ramipril and aldactone.
He was taken up for elective OPCAB 1 week after angiography.
Renal function was monitored regularly to adjust diuretic dose.
There was no feature of end organ dysfunction.
STS risk of mortality was 2.4%.
Repeat echocardiographic assessment revealed improvement of LVEF to 15% and decrease in PASP to 30 mm Hg and decrease in LV filling pressure.
OPCAB was performed through median sternotomy.
Left ITA was used for grafting left anterior descending artery (LAD).
After revascularizing LAD, right ITA (RITA) and RA composite, graft was prepared.
The distal end of RITA was used for revascularizing the diagonal artery.
There was significant improvement in systolic blood pressure after this distal anastomosis.
After these two grafts, heart was lifted for lateral and posterior wall vessels.
We make a longer skin incision, open the sternum widely, and release pericardium on the right side to displace the heart gradually.
This was supplemented with headlow and lateral tilt position.
Liberal doses of inotropic support were used.
RA was used for sequential grafting of obtuse marginal, posterior LV branch, and posterior descending artery.
All these five distal anastamoses were performed uneventfully.
The patient was electively ventilated for 2 days.
Echocardiography on 1st POD revealed improvement in LVEF to 20%.
He was started on low dose beta blockers after inotropic supports were weaned off.
He had slow and uneventful recovery.
Echocardiography on 4th POD revealed improvement in LVEF to 30% (Table 1).
He had persistent pleural drainage requiring prolonged intensive care unit stay.
After pleural drainage subsided and drains were removed, he was discharged on diuretics, low dose beta blocker, and ramipril.

"A 37-year-old African American female with a past medical history significant for stage 1 sarcoidosis presented to our facility with a chief complaint of shortness of breath.
Ten years prior, she presented with bilateral uveitis and lupus pernio (LP) on her right ear and was subsequently diagnosed with sarcoidosis.
She was successfully treated for these conditions and her sarcoidosis remained quiescent until three years ago, when, at an outside institution, she was discovered to have laryngeal involvement.
She was treated with prednisone 60 mg daily for several months and eventually tapered to 10 mg daily.
Her sarcoidosis remained well-controlled on this maintenance dose of prednisone until six months prior, at which time she self-discontinued her prednisone in favor of the homeopathic treatment Nopalea cactus juice, which unsubstantially claimed to have anti-inflammatory properties [4].
Subsequently, she developed dyspnea on exertion progressing to dyspnea at rest.
During this time her voice became increasingly hoarse and she experienced frequent episodes of difficulty swallowing.
In our emergency department, her physical examination was concerning for respiratory distress as she presented with inspiratory stridor and hoarseness.
She also had chronic-appearing, indurated lesions on her right ear.
Given that she had signs of upper airway disease for impending respiratory failure, an emergent bedside laryngoscopy was performed, revealing an obstructed airway with the epiglottis retroflexed over the glottis and significant edema in the arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds.
She was immediately treated with high-dose intravenous dexamethasone and taken emergently to the operating room (OR) to secure her airway for concern for complete upper airway obstruction, which was confirmed with direct visualization of her larynx in the OR.
She was intubated for a surgical airway, and after taking biopsies from the lingual surface of her epiglottis, a #4 cuffed Shiley™ tracheostomy was placed.
Her respiratory status immediately stabilized, was extubated, and transferred to our medical intensive care unit.
Her tracheostomy was exchanged to a #4 cuffless Shiley on postoperative day 5.
During this time she was transitioned from intravenous dexamethasone to prednisone 60 mg daily.
Biopsies ultimately revealed non-necrotizing epithelioid granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis (Figure 1).
She was prescribed this high-dose prednisone for three months, and after receiving education for self-tracheostomy care, she was discharged home.
At her subsequent one-month and three-month follow-up visits, she denied any further respiratory issues.
Repeat laryngoscopies showed significant improvement in the edema in the arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, but the epiglottis continued to obscure the glottis despite therapy with high-dose prednisone.
Methotrexate was initiated while prednisone was tapered to 10 mg daily; however, this regimen failed and her prednisone dosage was increased to 20 mg daily to reduce edema.
Because she declined surgical treatment, she will continue with medical management with immunosuppressive therapy to facilitate eventual de-cannulation.

"The patient, a 4-year-old boy, was diagnosed as having Blau syndrome based on the manifestation of typical clinical features (ankle and wrist arthritis/tenosynovitis, diffuse eczematous rash, and uveitis), histologic evidence of noncaseating granulomas, and a heterozygous NOD2 mutation (p.R334W).
Ocular involvement was initially controlled by topical and oral corticosteroids, but over the years visual impairment progressed.
Other manifestations of Blau syndrome (arthritis and rash) subsided over time.
Bilateral panuveitis progressed after age 5 years, and was initially treated with methotrexate.
However, ocular inflammation persisted despite the addition of local steroid injections and repeated intravenous (IV) bolus methylprednisolone treatment; therefore, when the patient was age 10 years, infliximab (initially at 5 mg/kg increased to 10 mg/kg IV every 4 to 6 weeks) was initiated.
Although there was an initial improvement, 1 year after this treatment was started uveitis worsened, and at age 12 years infliximab was discontinued.
Adalimumab (24 mg/m2 every 2 weeks) was then initiated and the dosage of methotrexate (15 mg/m2/weekly) was increased.
However, ocular disease remained active.
Mycophenolate mofetil (750 mg/m2) and then abatacept (10 mg/kg/month IV) were sequentially administered, without significant improvement.
At age 16 years the patient still had granulomatous retinal lesions and anterior chamber inflammation, and macular edema developed, which led to retinal detachment.
In addition to the other steroid therapy, corticosteroid pulse therapy was necessary to control disease flares, with an average of 3 boluses/month for 6 consecutive months.
Because of the supposed autoinflammatory nature of Blau syndrome, we initiated a trial of IL-1 antibody administration (2 mg/kg/month of canakinumab).
During the 6 months that followed, no ocular flare occurred and no steroid pulse therapy was necessary.
Concomitant treatment with oral methotrexate and low-dose prednisone (0.2 mg/kg/day) remained unchanged.
Figure 1 shows fluorangiograms before treatment and after the first 6 injections.
The drug was well tolerated with no side effects, and findings on laboratory tests (performed monthly) were normal.

"The institutional review board (Chengdu Military General Hospital) approved this work and waived the need for informed consent.
In 2013, a 66-year-old farmer with a history of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with continuous palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating and nausea with no obvious predisposing causes.
The patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and acute confusion.
After an immediate electrical conversion, his consciousness was gradually restored, and symptoms relieved.
Then, this patient was transferred to the Department of Cardiology for further evaluations and treatments.
The patient's blood pressure was 105/75 mm Hg upon admission, with a heart rate of 75 beats/min, body temperature of 36.6°C and respiration rate of 18 times/min.
The heart border extended to the left, with the apical impulse located in the left 5th intercostal space, 1.0 cm lateral to the midclavicular line.
The patient had a history of hypertension over 30 years without regular antihypertensive medication.
The highest blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg.
There was no family history of early coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.
He did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs, and rarely consumed alcohol.
He also reported no known contacts with sick persons and no recent travel.
Twelve-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) of VT indicated that the origin of VT was at the boundary between right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and tricuspid valve.
When VT increased to 150 beats/min or higher, no epsilon waves were found in the precordial leads (Figure1A and B).
In contrast, when VT decreased to 120 beats/min or lower, epsilon waves appeared in leads V1–V2 (Figure1C).
Notably, the epsilon waves preceded QRS waves in leads V1–V2, while endocardiac tracing confirmed that the corresponding local potential originating from RVOT appeared prior to the ventricular rhythm (Figure ​(Figure1D).1D).
Sinus ECG in the year of 2013 suggested a slight left deviation of electric axis, with a heart rate of 87 beats/min and flat T waves in lead II.
T wave inversions were found in leads III, avF and V1–V3, meanwhile epsilon waves were found following QRS complex in leads V1–V3 (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B).
When the lead avR was amplified, epsilon waves were also found behind QRS waves (Figure ​2C).
Atrial premature beats appeared occasionally.
Moreover, ventricular premature beats were also found to originate from the right ventricular apex, with epsilon waves appearing behind QRS waves (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B).
In contrast, sinus ECG obtained in the year of 1999 revealed similar left deviation of electric axis, flat T waves and T wave inversions, but absence of epsilon waves (Figure ​(Figure2A).2A).
Data from biochemical assays were as follows: cardiac troponin I level was 0.714 μg/L (normal range, 0–0.06 μg/L), serum B-type natriuretic peptide level was 466.530 pg/mL (normal range, 0–100 pg/mL), serum d-dimer level was 8.14 mg/L (normal range, 0–0.55 mg/L), blood urea level was 11.69 mmol/L (normal range, 2.90–7.20 mmol/L), serum creatinine level was 144.00 μmol/L (normal range, 44–133 μmol/L), serum uric acid level was 611.40 μmol/L (normal range, 100–432 μmol/L), and endogenous creatinine clearing value was 57.90 mL/min (normal range, >80 mL/min).
Echo data revealed remarkably enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, and widened ROVT.
Uncoordinated motions of the left and right ventricular walls were also detected.
Moreover, we also found aortic valve degradation with slight regurgitation, slight mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
The left ventricular diastolic function was reduced to 55% (Figure ​3A and B).
The coronary angiogram revealed no vascular stenosis (Figure ​3C–E).
Based on the above-mentioned examinations, this patient met at least 2 major criteria, the bilateral ventricular dilation and the existence of epsilon waves, providing diagnostic support for ARVC.
A diet with low salt and low fat was suggested.
The patient was also treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75 mg daily, p.o.), amiodarone (200 mg daily, p.o.), furosemide (20 mg daily, i.v.), and compound α-ketoacid tablets (2.52 g daily, p.o.).
Moreover, VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found during radiofrequency ablation (Figure 4).
The substrate voltage mapping revealed that the anterior wall of RVOT was wrapped by circular scar (Figure 5A).
Considering the association of VT with scar areas, substrate ablation was chosen for this patient.
The residual potentials in the scar areas were searched, and then linear and focal ablations were performed (Figure ​5B).
Neither programmed stimulation nor induced stimulation could induce VT after the procedure was completed, indicating the success of operation.
The ECG after radiofrequency ablation showed sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 61 beats/min, T wave inversions in leads III and avF, and epsilon waves and T wave inversions in leads V1–V3 (Figure 2D).
This patient was discharged from hospital on day 9 with a regimen of metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75 mg daily, p.o.), amiodarone hydrochloride tablets (200 mg daily, p.o.), spironolactone tablets (40 mg daily, p.o.), and fosinopril sodium tablets (10 mg daily, p.o.).
The patient was followed up 3 months after discharge.
He had no recurrent palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating or nausea.
Although ARVC was the main diagnosis at the time of this patient's initial presentation, it is essential in such cases to perform a reassessment for the presence of structural heart disease, which can evolve over time.

"An 8-year-old boy with S549R/1717-1G > A genotype was started on ivacaftor (150 mg b.i.d.) on compassionate use.
At the age of 9 months he was diagnosed with CF due to failure to thrive.
His previous history was remarkable for recurring nasal polyposis requiring endoscopic surgery and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency necessitating enzyme replacement therapy.
He grew with body weight and height along the 10th percentile.
He suffered from rather mild respiratory symptoms, primarily intermittent productive cough, and had close to normal lung function parameters in previous years as measured by body plethysmography and spirometry (minimal z-score of FEV1: −1.2).
Sputum cultures grew Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus on several occasions.
After 6 weeks of ivacaftor treatment, the patient reported clinical improvements in cough frequency, sputum production, physical performance, and less salt cravings.
He gained 1.4 kg in body weight without changing the dose of his pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.
His sweat chloride level (Macroduct®) decreased from 115 mmol/l before ivacaftor to 40 mmol/l after 6 weeks and 52 mmol/l after 41 weeks (normal < 30 mmol/l [11]) of treatment.
His FEV1 increased from 1.25 L (−1.2 z-score) to 1.65 L (+0.5 z-score) after 41 weeks of ivacaftor therapy.
The LCI (normal < 8) measured by N2-MBW decreased from 14.5 to 8.3 after 6 weeks and 7.8 after 41 weeks of ivacaftor treatment (Table 1 and Fig.1).

"A 64-year-old female was found lying down after 10–12 hours of binge drinking.
She was taken to an outlying emergency department (ED), and subsequently transferred to our hospital with mental status changes and respiratory distress and hypoxia for further management.
She had a past history of rheumatoid arthritis, congestive heart failure, controlled hypertension, and alcoholism.
She smoked two packs a day for the past 50 years.
On presentation, she had a blood pressure of 176/80 mm/Hg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respirations 24 bpm, temperature 98°F (36.7°C).
Arterial blood gases on room air showed a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 60, PaO2 61 mm/Hg, H−CO3 29 mEq/L, and saturation 92% which improved to 95% with oxygen by a high flow non-rebreather mask.
On physical examination she was lethargic, disoriented, dysarthritic, but without neurological focalization.
Scattered expiratory wheezes were noted bilaterally along with normal heart sounds.
The remaining results of her physical examination and routine laboratory results were unremarkable with the exception of a leukocyte count of 14,000/dL with 88% neutrophils.
Repeated vitals signs were consistent with a normal blood pressure but evidence of tachycardia in the monitor.
Repeated ABG’s on the non-rebreather mask showed: pH 7.22, PaCO2 78, PaO2 140 mm Hg, H−CO3 30 mEq/L, and hemoglobin SaO2 97%.
In the ED she was started on IV steroids and antibiotics for a COPD exacerbation.
As part of the diagnostic workup, she underwent a chest x ray that did not show any infiltrates or any major abnormal findings.
The ECG was only significant for sinus tachycardia.
Given the negative findings on chest x ray, sinus tachycardia on ECG, and an increased A-a gradient, the patient was sent for a spiral chest CT with contrast to rule out a pulmonary embolism.
During CT about 100–150 mL of air was inadvertently injected through the right antecubital vein using a power contrast injector (estimated by the technician and approximation of volumes on available imaging).
Concurrent imaging (CT) showed a significant amount of air in the right atrium and right ventricular cavity (Figure 1), and air mixed with contrast in the main pulmonary artery and its proximal branches divisions of the pulmonary circulation (Figure 2).
Concurrently, a filling defect was noted in the right lower lobe artery consistent with pulmonary thromboembolism (Figures 3, ​,4).4).
The patient maintained hemodynamic stability with Trendelenburg, and left lateral decubitus positioning (Durant’s maneuver), and supportive care alone and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation.
Her respiratory distress worsened, and she was placed temporarily on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) without improvement and a few hours later she was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.
Intravenous full dose heparin infusion (initial bolus, 80 units/kg, followed by 18 units/kg/hour) was initiated for treatment of concurrent thromboembolism.
Echocardiography did not show any evidence of right or left ventricular failure.
Subsequent echocardiography done 24 hours later did not show any evidence of intracardiac air and complete resolution of the air embolism.
During the next 48 hours, she remained hemodynamically stable with no requirements of vasoactive agents.
She was finally extubated 48 hours after the initial presentation.
She was later discharged home on warfarin with subsequent outpatient follow-up.

"A 35-year-old woman presented to the medical emergency department with low-grade fever for 3 weeks, vomiting for 1 week and anuria for 3 days.
She also reported dysuria and breathlessness for 1 week.
There was no history of decreased urine output, dialysis, effort intolerance, chest pain or palpitation, dyspnoea and weight loss.
Menstrual history was within normal limit but she reported gradually progressive loss of appetite.
Family history included smoky urine in her younger brother in his childhood, who died in an accident.
On general survey, the patient was conscious and alert.
She was dyspnoeic and febrile.
Severe pallor was present with mild pedal oedema.
Blood pressure was 180/100 mm Hg and pulse rate of 116/min regular.
No evidence of jaundice, clubbing cyanosis or lymphadenopathy was found.
Physical examination revealed bibasilar end-inspiratory crepitations in lungs and suprapubic tenderness.
There was no hepatosplenomegaly or ascites.
Cardiac examination was normal.
She was found to have severe bilateral hearing loss, which was gradually progressive for 5 years.
The fundi were bilaterally pale.
The patient was referred to the department of ophthalmology for a comprehensive eye examination.
Her visual acuity was documented as 6/18 in both eyes with no obvious lenticular opacity.
Slit-lamp examination showed bilateral anterior lentiglobus (figure 1) with posterior lenticonus (figure 2).
Distant direct ophthalmoscopy revealed oil droplet sign (a suggestive confirmation of the presence of lenticonus); and peripheral retina revealed multiple yellowish white lesion-like flecks in the mid-periphery, and few blot haemorrhages indicative of hypertensive changes (figures 3 and ​4).
"
"A 56-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of dysphagia.
He was diagnosed with a middle thoracic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma by both a gastroscopy and a biopsy.
A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed an enlarged azygos vein (a diameter of 2.5 cm) that was a continuation of the IVC (Fig.1a, b).
A CT scan of the abdomen showed a defect in the suprarenal segment of the inferior vena cava and direct drainage of the hepatic vein into the right atrium.
After consultation with the thoracic surgery department clinicians and the anaesthesiology department, we decided to perform a McKeown oesophagectomy.
The patient was anaesthetised with a double-lumen tube and underwent a standard posterolateral thoracotomy by traditional open surgery.
We first performed the jugular and femoral vein percutaneous puncture to create a veno-venous bypass and then connected the pressure sensor system to the monitor.
The monitor displayed the real-time pressure value of the jugular vein and the femoral vein.
Macroscopically, the diameter of the azygos arch was approximately 2.5 cm (Fig.1c), and the superior edge of the tumour adhered tightly to the arch of the azygos vein.
When the arch of the azygos vein was pulled with a rubber hose to dissociate it from the carcinoma, the monitor showed that the femoral vein pressure increased to 52 mmH2O; the pressure returned to a normal value when we opened the bypass between the femoral vein and the jugular vein (Fig.2).
The surgery was performed smoothly, without injury to the azygos vein, and the postoperative recovery was uneventful.
The pathology of the resected specimen showed a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and no evidence of malignancy in 15 of the lymph nodes.
After 5 months of follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, with no evidence of recurrent disease either clinically or on CT.
"
"A 53-year-old man came to our hospital with signs and symptoms of acute heart failure after a 2-week history of progressive breathlessness.
He had a history of recurrent skin abscesses and atopic dermatitis and regularly visited a dermatologist in our hospital.
On arriving at our hospital, his extremities were warm and dry.
According to the New York Heart Association criteria, he had class III congestive heart failure (CHF).
An electrocardiogram revealed diffuse nonspecific T-wave changes, low voltage (<5 mm) in the extremity leads and poor R-wave progression in the anterior chest leads.
Multiple sporadic ventricular premature beats were seen (Figure 1).
Chest x-ray film confirmed right pleural effusion, and mild cardiomegaly but no pulmonary congestion (Figure 2).
Blood tests showed severely elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (901 pg/mL) and markedly raised IgE (12 000 IU/mL) without eosinophilia (eosinophil count of 1.62×108/L).
Biochemical analysis revealed no significant findings: blood urea nitrogen of 14.3 mg/dL [reference value (RV): 7.00–22.00], creatinine of 0.90 mg/dL (RV: 0.60–1.00), C-reactive protein (CRP) of 0.2 mg/dL (RV: 0.00–0.50), serum amyloid A (SAA) of 7.0 μg/mL (RV: 0–8.0), and troponin T of 0.07 ng/mL (RV: 0–0.1).
Immunology testing revealed negative perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and no elevation of myeloperoxidase antibodies.
The distribution of albumin and globulin in the serum was normal.
Serum protein immuno-electrophoresis did not reveal M-protein, and urinalysis revealed no Bence-Jones protein.
Transthoracic echocardiography (Figure 3) showed concentric mild left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (12 mm) without the characteristic granular sparkling appearance and pericardial effusion, preserved ejection fraction (60%), and bi-atrial enlargement with normal ventricular chambers.
Doppler-derived LV diastolic filling demonstrated a restrictive pattern with a trans-mitral early filling wave deceleration time of 160 ms and an elevated E/A ratio of 2.8.
A markedly elevation of E/e’ ratio of 27.3 indicated elevated LV filling pressure.
On day 1 of hospitalization, we prescribed an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and low-dose diuretics.
On day 3 of hospitalization, after initiating ACE inhibitor and diuretic therapy, the patient’s symptoms resolved.
The dermatologists performed a biopsy of a blue macula of the forehead skin.
On day 4, we introduced a low-dose β-blocker and performed an endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), obtaining 3 fragments of the right ventricular septum because diagnostic confirmation of cardiac amyloidosis requires the demonstration of amyloid deposits.
In addition, we performed right heart catheterization (RHC), and coronary angiography to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease.
The data obtained from the RHC indicated subset type IV according to the Forrester classification.
The right ventricular pressure curve did not show a dip-and-plateau configuration.
Skin biopsy revealed hyperkeratosis in the epidermis and mild inflammatory changes throughout the dermis with an infiltration of lymphocytes.
The specimen exhibited apple-green birefringence with polarized light after Congo red staining (Figure 4).
Histological examination of the myocardial specimen showed no signs suggesting myocarditis, eosinophilic granulomas, or cardiomyopathy with iron deposition, but Congo red staining revealed amyloid deposits (Figure 5).
In addition, a strongly positive immunohistochemical reaction to immunoglobulin λ-chain in the myocardial interstitium led us to diagnose this patient’s systemic amyloidosis as AL amyloidosis.
The patient generally tolerated the low-dose β-blocker well and was discharged on day 10 with no complications.
The patient is currently being followed-up at 6-month intervals as an out-patient, with no exacerbation of the CHF thus far.

"A 20-year-old male with cystic fibrosis was transferred to Houston Methodist Hospital in January 2013 to be evaluated for lung and kidney transplant.
Patients with cystic fibrosis are known to develop chronic lung infections that adapt over time to this unique anatomic niche (14, 15).
His complicated medical history included pancreatic insufficiency, liver transplantation in 2004, steroid-induced diabetes, end-stage renal disease, and testicular cancer.
He had a long history of respiratory infections with several multidrug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA.
He was treated with ceftaroline at an outside hospital immediately prior to transfer to Houston Methodist Hospital.
The patient was periodically hospitalized from January to July 2013 and was treated for recurrent respiratory and catheter-related infections caused by MRSA and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
His antibiotic exposure included long treatment courses with various agents, including meropenem, ceftazidime, doxycycline, vancomycin, linezolid, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and inhaled and systemic colistin and tobramycin.
Shortly after being readmitted to our hospital in June 2013, MRSA was grown from cultures of blood and respiratory specimens.
These two isolates were resistant to clindamycin, linezolid, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and susceptible to minocycline, rifampin, and vancomycin.
His blood isolate grew confluently around the ceftaroline Etest strip, yielding an MIC of >32 mg/liter.
Five additional S. aureus respiratory tract isolates were available for further study.
All MRSA isolates from this patient had a small-colony-variant (SCV) phenotype.

"In March 2009, a 21-year-old man was admitted to another institution with symptoms of intermittent fever, headache, polyarthralgias, skin rash over the trunk, and petechiae in the fingers and palms.
The patient was previously healthy, had no history of drug abuse, and took no regular medication.
He also had no pets and had not traveled recently.
He had been in his usual state of health until one month before admission, when intermittent high fever developed (maximum axillary temperature, >39 °C).
In addition, he reported headaches, bilateral and symmetric arthralgia on the wrists and hands (with an inflammatory pattern), petechiae over the palms and fingers, salmon-colored rash on the trunk, nausea, and vomiting.
An evanescent, salmon-colored rash was observed on his chest and abdomen, and 2-mm petechiae covered the palms and the fingers.
No signs suggested arthritis, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.
Blood testing showed elevated inflammatory markers (Table II).
The electrocardiographic (ECG) and chest radiographic results were normal.
Ibuprofen (1,200 mg/d) and acetaminophen (as needed) were begun and provided symptomatic relief.
An extensive evaluation was performed, including blood cultures, viral and bacterial serologic studies, immunologic screening (rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies), and computed tomographic (CT) studies of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and cranium.
No significant changes were found.
However, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed circumferential, mild pericardial effusion (maximal diameter, 8 mm), with no signs of tamponade or other relevant findings.
A few days later, dyspnea and diffuse chest pain developed.
The pain was relieved by chest anteflexion and aggravated by deep inspiration and by lying supine.
The patient was hypotensive, tachycardic, and hyperpneic, and he manifested jugular venous distention.
The ECG showed sinus tachycardia and diffuse ST-segment elevation (Fig.1), the chest radiograph revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette (Fig.2), and the inflammatory markers were again elevated (Table II).
A repeat TTE showed an increase in the pericardial effusion (maximal diameter, 12 mm) (Fig.3) and collapse of the right heart chambers.
Emergency pericardiocentesis drained 60 mL of serosanguineous fluid.
When repeated, CT of the chest and abdomen revealed mild right and severe left pleural effusion, as well as mild ascites.
Thoracocentesis was then performed, during which 350 mL of serosanguineous pleural fluid was drained.
Both heart and lung fluids were exudates that yielded negative microbiologic examination and were unremarkable upon histologic analysis.
The diagnosis of AOSD was established, and the patient was medicated with prednisone (0.5 mg/kg/d), with major clinical and laboratory improvement (Table II).
There was also ST-segment normalization, and the follow-up echocardiogram showed only mild pericardial effusion (2–3 mm), without hemodynamic compromise.
Screening for autoimmune and infectious disorders was repeated, and no significant changes were found.
The patient was discharged from the hospital on a regimen of prednisone.
There was a recurrence of pericardial and pleural effusion 2 months after discharge (after corticosteroid weaning and withdrawal), which was resolved by resuming the prednisone therapy.
Ten months after discharge, the patient presented at our institution for a follow-up visit.
He was asymptomatic and was maintained on corticosteroid therapy.
Follow-up ECG and TTE showed no significant changes (Figs.4 and ​5).
"
"A 38-year-old woman presented to our Emergency Department with severe abdominal pain.
She had no history of drug use or constipation.
She said that she had intermittent bloody diarrhea.
Physical examination revealed rebound tenderness and guarding over the abdomen.
Stool microscopy was negative for amoeba trophozoites or any parasites.
Fecal occult blood was found.
Sedimentation was 27 mm/s, CRP (nephelometry) was 65.6 mg/L (normal range 0–5), anti-nuclear antibody was 0.4 (0–0.8 negative), anti-ds DNA <10 (<20 negative), white blood cell count was 14.98 (normal range 4–10), hemoglobin level was 10.9, neutro-phil count was 13.14, platelet count was 473 (100–300), urea level was 17 mg/dl, BUN level was 7.94 mg/dl, creatinine level was 0.56 mg/dl, AST was 20 U/L, and ALT was 24 U/L.
HIV was negative.
Abdominal ultrasound scanning showed free fluid at the right paracolic, perihepatic, left paracolic gutters and pelvis.
Upon detection of air-fluid level and free air under the diaphragm on erect abdominal x-ray, emergency laparotomy was performed.
In the operation, multiple perforation areas were found in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, and transverse colon.
Wide resection of the transverse colon with descending and sigmoid colon resection was undertaken (Figure 1).
Pathergy test was positive.
The patient had recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcers 4–5 times within the past year.
Eye examination results were normal.
Computed tomography revealed extensive thrombus within the inferior vena cava extending through the right and middle hepatic vein (Figure 2).
The patient received corticosteroid, anticoagulant, and immunosuppressive therapy.
Our patient is still alive and healthy 53 weeks later (Figure 3).
In macroscopy, the transverse colon was 50 cm and sigmoid and descending colon specimens were 27 cm in length.
Specimens of both colon segments were 4 cm in diameter.
Perforation areas were evident in the serosal surface.
Colonic wall and bowel mucosa was edematous and hyperemic.
Plicae were regular in their course.
There were 3 roundish, punched-out perforations in the transverse colon and 4 in the descending and sigmoid colon, which were somewhat separate from the colonic wall, with the largest being 2 cm in diameter (Figure 4).
There were multiple ulcers (the largest was 1 cm in diameter) in different locations, which were not merging together, and were somewhat separate from the surrounding mucosa via a certain limit, covered with exudate and surrounded by a hyperemic region.
There were no macroscopic lymph nodes in the serosa.
Numerous samples were taken from ulcerated and perforated regions and normal mucosa.
The samples were submitted for routine microscopic tissue follow-up.
Hematoxylin-eosin, tissue Giemsa and PAS-stained slides were prepared for examination.
In microscopic examination, there were neutrophil leukocyte and lymphocyte reaction around and within the walls and lumens of arterioles, and venules around the perforated and ulcerated lesions (Figures 5 and ​and6).6).
There were well-organized thrombi and intimal proliferation within some vessels (Figures 7 and ​and8).8).
There was marked acute peritonitis.
Surface epithelium and colonic crypts were regular within the colonic mucosa apart from the ulcerated or perforated lesions.
Samples were free of parasites or their eggs.

"A 77-year-old woman with dysphagia presented with a two-week history of rash characterized by brown plaques with erythematous borders and overlying thick scales involving the face and a prior percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube site (Fig.1a, c).
No oral or conjunctival involvement was present.
She had been receiving parenteral nutrition for two months following removal of the PEG tube due to infection.
Although the differential diagnosis included drug hypersensitivity, autoimmune disorders and nutritional deficiency, the rash appearance was most consistent with acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption secondary to zinc deficiency.
Her serum zinc level was 12 mcg/dL (normal, 55–150 mcg/dL), and the rash resolved within one week of parenteral zinc supplementation (Fig.1b, d).
Zinc is essential for protein synthesis and wound healing.
Acrodermatitis enteropathica presents in infancy as a periorificial desquamative dermatitis, resulting from an autosomal recessive mutation that impairs zinc absorption. A similar syndrome may occur due to nutritional zinc deficiency, and has been reported in the setting of parenteral nutrition that fails to include zinc supplementation; a prompt response to supplementation helps to confirm the diagnosis.
A recent national shortage of parenteral zinc in the United States likely contributed to this patient’s presentation.
"
"A 23-year-old man with a history of severe aplastic anemia (SAA) underwent bone marrow transplantation from his HLA-haploidentical mother in January 2014.
The conditioning regimens consisted of busulphan cyclophosphamide and antithymocyte globulin (BUCY+ATG) (10).
Cyclosporine A (CsA) and short-term methotrexate (MTX) plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were used as prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (11).
Standard measures were adopted for the prevention of infectious complications, which included fluconazole for antifungal prophylaxis and acyclovir to prevent herpes-related infections.
A hemogram revealed the reconstruction of granulocytes (ANC>0.5×109/L) on day +12 post-transplantation.
The patient developed grade II acute GVHD of the skin on day +42 post-transplantation.
This was treated by treatment with a standard-dose of methyl-prednisolone, which achieved a complete response (CR).
The patient's chronic GVHD (cGVHD) of the skin gradually progressed from day +100 post-transplantation and he was treated with prednisolone and CsA.
On day 120 post-transplantation, he complained of a cough and antibiotics were administered.
A blood analysis revealed the following: WBC, 2.34×109/L; ANC, 1.72×109/L; hemoglobin, 85 g/L; and platelets, 72×109/L.
Although both a chest computed tomography (CT) scan and tests for pathogens via routine culturing, including blood tests for Beta-D glucan (G-test) and Galactomannan (GM-test) were all negative, the patient's cough did not respond to antibiotics and we empirically initiated treatment with voriconazole (6 mg/kg/12h for the first day, followed by 4 mg/kg/12h).
Liver toxicity occurred during voriconazole treatment, thus the anti-fungal regimen was changed to micafungin (100 mg/d).
However, the persistent cough did not improve and hoarseness developed after two weeks of treatment - ulcers were then observed in the throat by laryngoscopy (Fig.1a).
The patient developed severe dyspnea in the following week when anti-infection and topical treatments were applied.
Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed an irregular, nodular material with white moss, which nearly obstructed the bronchus; however, chest CT imaging was negative (Fig.1b and c).
The histopathological examination of biopsy specimens revealed an Aspergillus species (Fig.1d).
The patient was diagnosed with pseudomembranous Aspergillus tracheobronchitis type ITBA based on the results of bronchoscopy and a pathological examination (12).
The antibiotic and micafungin treatments were ceased and liposomal amphotericin B (liposomal AmB) was administered daily at a target dose of 3 mg/kg.
The patient's serum creatinine level rose from 60.4 μmol/L to 168 μmol/L during the first 7 days of liposomal AmB treatment.
Due to progressive renal dysfunction, the anti-fungal regimen was switched to a combination of posaconazole (400 mg/12 h) and caspofungin [50 mg, daily (70 mg for the first dose)].
The combination therapy continued for 2 weeks, until the previous nodules in the throat completely disappeared under bronchoscopy (Fig.2a); however, a repeat chest CT scan showed progression (Fig.2b).
The symptom of dyspnea gradually progressed, thus fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed to remove the obstructive material from the patient's airways once a week for two weeks.
All of the symptoms were relieved and the final chest CT scan showed negative results before the discontinuation of anti-fungal therapy, and all of the tests were negative for Aspergillus.
Posaconazole was administered as a secondary prophylactic treatment and the patient was discharged from hospital.
The patient is still being followed and remains free of any recurrence of invasive fungal infection.

"A 41-year-old man with weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain was referred for an abdominal CT scan to rule out intraabdominal pathology.
A dedicated CT of the abdomen was performed at our institution according to our standard venous phase protocol.
Following ingestion of positive oral contrast material (barium sulfate suspension 2.1% w/v, Mallinckrodt) and injection of 125 ml of iopromide, 300 mg I/mL (Ultravist, Bayer HealthCare), helical CT was obtained with a 65-s delays using a 64-slice GE Lightspeed VCT scanner (GE Medical Systems; Milwaukee, WI).
Axial sections of the abdomen showed a large (18×22×22 cm) heterogeneous retroperitoneal mass probably arising from the left adrenal gland containing multiple areas of macroscopic fat (Fig.1).
The patient had no documented clinical or laboratory evidence of adrenal hormonal excess.
On the basis of the clinical history and CT findings, the patient underwent surgical resection of the left adrenal mass, which was found on pathologic examination to represent a low-grade adrenocortical carcinoma.
"
"A 23 year old white male with a 4 year history of Crohn's disease presented with an acute two day history of malaise, fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and stomal diarrhoea.
He complained of joint pains affecting the shoulders, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeals, knees and ankles.
There was also a rash on the elbows, ankles and feet, which began as erythematous macules and evolved to vesico-pustular lesions followed by crusting.
There was no history of sexual exposure or any intercurrent infection.
He was on no regular medication, but had discontinued Pentasa 4 months earlier.
One month earlier he had undergone a laparotomy to excise a complex ileo-cutaneous fistula with blind tracts, and two weeks earlier a defunctioning ileostomy had been created in view of persistent abdominal pain.
The cutaneous fistula had been present for a year, but was associated with a terminal ileal stricture and ileo-rectal fistula of at least 2 years duration.
His bowel disease had been resistant to immunosuppressive drugs including azathioprine, corticosteroiods and three infusions of Infliximab a year earlier.
There had been no extra-intestinal manifestations.
On admission to the hospital, he was thin, afebrile with a resting tachycardia of 125/minute.
The rest of the cardio-respiratory examination was normal.
The abdomen was minimally tender around the ileostomy without guarding or rebound tenderness.
Examination of the skin revealed some pustules and crusts around the elbows, ankles and feet (Fig 1 and  2).
The buttocks were spared.
There were clinical signs of synovitis of the wrists, proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints, and also both ankles.
Results of the laboratory tests showed a haemoglobin of 13.1 gm/dl, white blood count 15.8 × 109/L, platelets 585 × 109/L, C- reactive protein 37.7 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 69 mm/hr.
Urea and electrolytes, complement, urine analysis and microscopy were normal.
Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cryoglobulins and Hepatitis B and C serology were negative.
Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no signs of endocarditis, and multiple blood cultures were sterile.
A skin biopsy from the ankle revealed a perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with prominent neutrophils and associated fibrinoid necrosis of vessels consistent with 'leukocytoclastic' vasculitis.
He was commenced on 60 mg prednisolone per day leading to prompt and complete resolution of all features.
The dose of prednisolone was rapidly tapered over the course of one month by the patient, faster than advised but without any recurrence over the following 3 years.

"A woman aged 31 years, G2P2, without any pathological past history, with good prenatal care, with a normal prenatal analysis, blood pressure during the follow-up was normal, admitted for elective caesarian section at 38 weeks of amenorrhea.
During realization of the spinal anesthesia the patient presented peak of the hypertensive (180/100 mm Hg) which normalized after a few minutes without treatment.
In post-partum, after 12 hours of the caesarian section the lady presented a severe headache with apyrexia then she developed three episodes of generalized tonico-clonic convulsions.
The 1st convulsion ceased 1 min after the measures of resuscitation and injection of diazepam IV.
The post-critical clinical examination found an afebrile patient and blood pressure at 140/90 mmHg and with Glasgow coma scale at 14 without any neurological deficit, there was no neck rigidity, diuresis was preserved.
The examination of urines by urinary strip was positive (+ + +).
The 2nd and 3th convulsive crisis stoped spontaneously within few seconds.
Laboratory findings of HELLP syndrome include raised liver enzymes (ASAT 525 IU/L and ALAT 214 IU/L), hemolysis (hemoglobinemia in 7 mg/dl) and low platelet count (44 000 platelet/mL).
Other investigations included the renal function tests, the inflammatory markers, the thyroid hormones were normal.
The viral serology was negative.
The patient was transferred to intensive care unit; she was treated immediately by magnesium sulfate associated to calcium channel blocker (nicardipine), antiepileptic (phenobarbital) and preventive dose of low molecular weight heparin.
The anemia and thrombopenia corrected by transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelet respectively.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), realized one hour after the first episode of convulsion showed zones in hyposignal T1, hypersignal T2 and flair sequences, interesting the cerebral cortex, parietal and occipital sub-cortical and the white matter.
Intracranial venous sinuses were permeable.
The diagnosis of the PRES syndrome secondary to the severe preeclampsia immediate post-partum was retained (Figure 1).
The electroencephalogram (EEG) realized in the second day did not showed anomaly.
The evolution was marked by the normalization of blood pressure, the normalization of the neurological state and of the biological analysis.
The patient discharged in good condition on day 5, with beta-blocker and sodium valproate maintained during three months.
THE MRI of the controle made three months later showed complete resolution of cerebral edema Figure 2.

"A 70-year-old man was referred to our hospital for gastric cancer that was detected during screening by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
No significant medical history was identified, except dysuria caused by bladder contraction.
Initial laboratory data showed a serum level of AFP of 32.3 ng/mL (normal range: 0-15 ng/mL), but no other abnormality, which included other tumor markers, such as, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9).
EGD revealed a 5-cm ulcerofungating mass that was comprised of three septate ulcers in the greater curvature of the gastric antrum.
A pathological examination of endoscopic biopsy tissues confirmed the presence of moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma.
Subsequent abdominopelvic computed tomography visualized a gastric mass with deep ulceration in the gastric antrum with perigastric lymph node enlargement.
No metastatic lesions were observed in the liver, lung or peritoneum, and chest radiography showed no significant findings.
Radical subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and Billroth II gastrojejunostomy were performed.
Grossly, the resected specimen contained double lesions: the first was a 5.8 cm × 3.2 cm ulcerofungating mass in the antrum, with extensive hemorrhage and light gray fibrosis; and the second was a nearby 2.5 cm × 2.0 cm ulcerative lesion (Figure ​1).
Microscopically, massive numbers of pleomorphic, bizarre tumor cells with hemorrhage (syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts) were observed in the first lesion.
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tissues revealed a bubbly purple cytoplasm and giant nuclei at a magnification of 40 × (Figure ​2A) and 100 × (Figure ​2B).
The tumor involved the proper muscle layer (T2a) and metastasis was found in four of 56 regional lymph nodes (N1).
Immunohistochemical staining showed positive immunoreactivity for β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (Figure ​3A) and focal positivity for AFP (Figure ​3B).
These findings confirmed the presence of gastric choriocarcinoma that contained small foci of an AFP-producing adenocarcinoma.
The second lesion was moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma, which extended to the submucosal layer (T1b).
It was close to, but distinct from the first lesion, which was negative by immunohistochemical staining for β-HCG and AFP.
The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on postoperative day 9.
Two weeks later, his HCG level was 176 mIU/mL (normal range: 0-10 mIU/mL) and his AFP level was 10.0 ng/mL.
Six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine (Xeloda; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ, USA) was started at 2500 mg/m2 per day for 14 d/cycle.
After two cycles, his β-HCG level had declined to < 3 mIU/mL, and has since remained at this level.
No recurrence or distant metastasis had occurred at his 4-year postoperative follow-up.

"A 45-year-old woman presents to her general practitioner because of left-sided neck and shoulder pain.
The pain was mild and non-specific and the patient's history was unremarkable.
She denied a history of smoking, excessive alcohol use and radiation exposure.
Physical examination demonstrated mild left sided cervical lymphadenopathy.
Routine blood tests revealed borderline elevated calcium of 10.5 mg/dL and subsequent work up exhibited a markedly elevated parathyroid hormone level of 286 pg/mL, so the patient was referred to otolaryngology for further evaluation.
Thyroid ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule in the left lower lobe of the thyroid.
CT scan of the neck revealed a 2 cm hypodense nodule on the posterior inferior aspect of the left lower thyroid and sestamibi scan showed increased uptake along the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe.
Elevated PTH along with an aberrant parathyroid gland on imaging suggests primary hyperparathyroidism.
Historically, hyperparathyroidism is associated with bone disease, renal stones and neuromuscular dysfunction, however, with the current screening modalities, most patients are caught early and often asymptomatic.3 Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma.
Infrequent causes include parathyroid hyperplasia, which would affect all four glands and rarely caused by parathyroid carcinoma.
Markedly elevated serum PTH and calcium levels leading to severe renal and bone manifestations are helpful in the diagnosis of cancer, however, it is usually discovered operatively based on local invasion and metastases.3
The primary indication for parathyroidectomy, historically, is for symptomatic patients.
Currently, since most patients are caught earlier, there are newer indications for surgery.
These include an asymptomatic patient with any of the following: glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min, bone density T-score <−2.5 at any site and/or previous fractures, age <50, and serum calcium 1.0 ng/dL above the upper limit of normal.3 This patient presented with pain, markedly elevated PTH, and was younger than 50 years old, so it was decided that surgery was the best choice in management.
The patient was brought to the operating room and underwent a parathyroidectomy.
The surgeon found the parathyroid gland to be firm and densely adherent to the thyroid capsule and overlying strap muscle, making it difficult to dissect.
There was no visible invasion into the capsule, surrounding muscle or regional lymph nodes.
The resected specimen was noted to be brownish grey in colour with scattered necrotic foci, and irregular texture.
On postoperative pathology, the specimen was confirmed positive for parathyroid carcinoma with capsular invasion, focal tumour necrosis, reactive fibrosis and local skeletal muscle invasion (figures 1 and ​2).
Margins were resected.
Immunohistochemical stains showed increased Ki-67 reactivity as well as strong Bcl-1 (cyclin D1) reactivity, which support the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma (figure 3).
Additionally, P57 staining was negative.
Although most reports of parathyroid carcinomas are associated with marked hypercalcaemia, non-functioning cancers in patients tend to behave more aggressively.1 Owing to the severity and uncertainty of the lesion, the patient was followed up postoperatively for repeat imaging to determine if residual tumour remained.
Repeat sestamibi and positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed residual activity along the surgical area so the patient subsequently underwent a second operation for a radical left neck dissection and left hemithyroidectomy.
The patient recovered very well postoperatively and it has now been 3 years since the second surgery.
The patient continues to do very well and is followed up every 3 months to monitor serum PTH and calcium levels.
She no longer reports of neck and shoulder pain.
Sometimes the patient's blood tests show marginally elevated PTH levels, however, she remains eucalcaemic and follow-up nuclear scans and PET scans continue to be negative.
The patient will continue to be monitored every 3 months indefinitely.

"The patient is an 18-year-old Han female admitted to Peking Union Medical College Hospital due to adrenal crisis triggered by pneumonia.
She has developed recurrent respiratory infections since age 5, and failed to respond to multiple hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccinations.
Reduced serum cortisol and ACTH levels were discovered at 16 when glucocorticoid replacement was initiated.
In addition, hair loss started from age 4, and absence of pubic and axillary hair was noticed after development of regular menstruation.
Her history includes nephrotic syndrome, which was confirmed to be minimal change nephropathy by renal biopsy.
Physical examination at admission revealed alopecia totalis, oral candidiasis, hypohidrosis, and trachyonychia.
Facial or dental abnormalities was not noted.
She is the only child in her family.
Symptom and signs of the above disorders were not identified among her nonconsanguineous parents.
Initial immunologic tests revealed remarkable panhypogammaglobulinemia and reduced cell counts of B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (Table ​(Table1).1).
CD4/CD8 ratio, as well as expression levels of various T-cell activation markers were in normal range, except increased proportion of CD8+/HLA-DR+ subset.
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative.
When regular hydrocortisone replacement was suspended, her 8:00 am serum cortisol was measured at 0.93 μg/dL, with ACTH <5.00 pg/mL.
Serum levels of other anterior pituitary hormones, as well as serum and urine osmolality were within reference range.
Both antiperoxidase antibody and antithyroglobulin antibody were negative.
She had positive antiprotein tyrosine phosphatase antibody, with fasting blood glucose at 5.9 mmol/L.
Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast suggested a normal pituitary.
She was diagnosed with CVID, isolated ACTH deficiency, and ectodermal dysplasia.
Symptoms of fever, cough, and vomiting cleared with antibiotics and stress-dose hydrocortisone treatment.
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy was suggested but denied by the parents.
At follow-up 1 year after her discharge, she reported no infection events during the previous year as she stayed at home and avoided outdoor activities.
Her glucocorticoid replacement was withdrawn 4 months after discharge, and she has only received traditional Chinese medicine ever since.
Lymphocyte subsets test done at the follow-up documented increased levels of B cells and T cells, while NK cell count remained below normal limit.
To assess her NK-cell activity, a flow cytometric procedure was done following previously described method.[10,11] Effector to target cell ratio was set at 10:1.
Less apoptosis of target cell line (12.43%, reference range 15.11–26.91%) was observed when cocultured with patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), indicating a deficient NK-cell cytotoxicity.

"A 26-year-old man of Portuguese descent with no significant past medical history presents with subacute onset of right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia, with marked expressive aphasia, word-finding difficulty, and rare paraphrasic errors.
Examination demonstrated right central facial weakness, 2–3/5 strength in the right arm and leg, and dysmetria in the right upper and lower extremities.
Reflexes were hyperactive on the right with a right-sided Babinski response.
MRI of the brain showed multiple bilateral concentric ring-like structures in the centrum semiovale and the corona radiata on T2 imaging (figure,A), consistent with the pattern of Balo concentric sclerosis.
There was associated restricted diffusion in 3 lesions and incomplete ring enhancement in 1 lesion.
CSF analysis showed 30 leukocytes (79% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes), erythrocyte count was 850, and oligoclonal bands were absent.
He was treated with 1 g of IV methylprednisolone daily for 5 days, with little improvement.
He then underwent 5 plasmapheresis exchanges, with significant improvement of motor, sensory, speech deficits, and gait.
Forty-five days after discharge, his examination showed 4+/5 strength in the right intrinsic muscles of the hand and a right-sided positional tremor.
Gait and tandem gait were normal.
He was placed on β-interferon-1a 44 μg subcutaneously 3 times a week, for treatment of presumed clinically isolated syndrome, with good response.
One year later, his neurologic examination was essentially normal.
There was no family history of demyelinating or autoimmune disorders.
His mother has a significant history of headaches and early-onset strokes, and was found to be a carrier of the Notch3 mutation consistent with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL).
His sister had a stroke in her 30s, and a history of migraine headaches, but has not undergone medical evaluation.
Testing for CADASIL in the patient showed the Notch3 mutation associated with CADASIL (transition C>T, nucleotide position 1750, codon 558).
Skin biopsy showed electron-dense extracellular material in close apposition to the smooth muscle of the vascular media1 (figure, B).

"In January 2009, a 57-year-old woman emergently presented with acute shortness of breath.
She had a 1-month history of progressive shortness of breath and a gradual decrease in exercise capacity secondary to mild dyspnea.
She reported no additional symptoms.
At age 40, she had been diagnosed with a stage IIA, T1bN1, left-sided breast cancer.
Initial treatment had included a lumpectomy and axillary node dissection.
She subsequently underwent 4 cycles of DOX therapy (75 mg/m2), followed by 8 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil.
Multigated acquisition scans before and after chemotherapy showed normal cardiac function.
After chemotherapy, she underwent left whole-breast radiation with an axillary boost.
Because the tumor had been estrogen receptor-positive, her subsequent medical regimen consisted only of anti-estrogen therapy.
She took tamoxifen for 5 years, and, ever since, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole.
In the 17 years after chemotherapy, she had been active and in relatively good health.
In addition to her other symptoms, she now presented with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension.
She had marked jugular venous distention, an S3, pulmonary rales, and trace peripheral edema.
Initial laboratory values were within normal limits except for an elevated level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (>2,000 pg/mL).
Results of investigation into the new-onset cardiomyopathy included normal cardiac enzyme levels, an electrocardiogram (ECG) that revealed no ischemic changes, and a coronary angiogram of normal appearance.
The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with frequent premature ventricular complexes, left-axis deviation, left atrial enlargement, and low-voltage QRS complexes with nonspecific ST changes (Fig.1).
A 2-dimensional echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 0.20, severe diffuse left ventricular (LV) hypokinesis, and a mildly dilated left atrium.
To better define the cause of the LV systolic dysfunction, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed.
It confirmed the LVEF of 0.20.
The T2-weighted sequence showed slow flow secondary to LV dysfunction, and no myocardial edema (Fig.2A).
Late gadolinium enhancement disclosed diffuse myocardial thinning and no scarring (Fig.2B).
The patient was treated medically.
Her symptoms progressively improved during therapy, which consisted of a β-blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, digoxin, and a diuretic.
The therapy was slowly tapered, and her LVEF increased from 0.20 to 0.55 during an 8-month period.
All medications except for low-dose metoprolol were discontinued after 1 year, and she remained asymptomatic.
"
"The patient was a 38-year-old Caucasian man of Spanish origin.
His height was 165 cm and his parents were cousins.
Both parents were of normal height and neither showed any minor anomalies of the EvC syndrome spectrum.
The patient had two healthy sisters.
His morphological features were: (a) normal mouth opening with missing lower incisors (Fig.1); (b) small chest, as determined by a cardiothoracic examination; and (c) disproportionately short extremities with one additional postaxial digit on each hand (Fig.2).
Although no sensory-motor deficit was noted, the patient presented with mild mental retardation.
Genetic analysis in his early infancy showed a previously reported homozygous nonsense mutation c.1195 C1T, p.Arg399X of EvC2, resulting in loss of function of the protein.(5) His parents were heterozygous carriers of the mutation.
In 1998, the patient underwent successful ostium primum atrial septal defect closure through a midsternotomy.
He re-presented with embolic cerebral ictus in 2007, and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation for common atrial flutter was performed successfully.
There were no serious aftereffects.
During a routine examination in 2012, a high-pitched systolic murmur was discovered.
Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm with hemiblock and right bundle branch block, while echocardiography revealed a dilated and hypertrophic left ventricle.
These abnormalities produced a flow that was directed to the left atrial appendage, leading to severe mitral valve regurgitation.
The patient’s systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 50 mmHg and his aortic valve was normal.
His medical treatment included ramipril, duloxetine, alprazolam and acenocumarol.
The patient was scheduled for mitral valve surgery.
In the operating theatre, the patient’s right femoral artery was cannulated.
A right thoracotomy was performed on the fourth intercostal space and bicaval cannulation was established.
Both veins were excluded.
The operation used a normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass without cross-clamping of the aorta in the beating heart.
To avoid air embolisms, continuous carbon dioxide (CO2) field flooding was applied using a CarbonAid CO2 diffuser (Cardia Innovation AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
The attempt to perform a mitral valve repair was unsuccessful and a bileaflet mechanical valve (no.29) was implanted.
No complications associated with anaesthesia occurred.
The patient’s postoperative recovery was uneventful and he was discharged on postoperative day 10.
After two years of follow-up, echocardiography revealed optimal function of the mitral valve and a decrease in systolic pulmonary artery pressure (30 mmHg).
"
"A 33 - year old woman presented to our cardiology service with signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure.
Her medical history was unremarkable, however a year ago and soon after her third child delivery, she had been admitted in another hospital for acute pulmonary oedema after labor.
Cor triatriatum with obstructive behavior causing pulmonary hypertension had bee diagnosed, while the left ventricle was structurally and functionally intact.
The patient at that time denied surgey and had been discharged on medical therapy.
At present admission the patient presented with NYHA functional class III, symptoms of heart failure and palpittions as a result of persistent atrial flutter.
On physical examination a loud pulmonary component of the 2nd heart sound and a diastolic murmur was heard in the mitral area.
Signs of right-sided heart failure were absent.
A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a moderately dilated left ventricle (LV), globally hypokinetic, with severely impaired systolic function (EF estimated ≥30%).
Left atrium (LA) was dilated, with a mobile, membrane-like echogenic structure into it.
Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) documented a fibromuscular membrane across the LA, dividing it into two compartments, a proximal one receiving the pulmonary venous flow and a distal one containing the left atrial appendage (LAA).
The two chambers communicated via a non-restrictive orifice, but the membrane prolapsed towards the mitral valve inflow causing severe obstruction.
Mitral valve appeared normal, with mild regurgitation.
Patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal defect (ASD) and anomalous venous connections were ruled out and the diagnosis of cor triatriatum was reconfirmed.
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the heart also revealed the fibromuscular septum into the left atrium and the low left ventricular ejection fraction [(LVEF) 30%, cardiac index 1,6 L/min/m2, cardiac output 2,7 L/min] (figure ​1).
Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries.
With these findings the patient was scheduled for surgery.
Anesthetic induction was achieved with standard technique including administration of sodium pentothal, sevofluorane, fentanyl and muscle relaxant.
Invasive monitoring included the use of right radial arterial lines, a pulmonary artery catheter and a foley catheter with temperature probe to measure bladder temperature as an indicator of core body temperature.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was also instituted.
Surgery was performed through a median sternotomy.
Connection to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was achieved by standard ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation.
Mildly hypothermic (32°C) CPB was established.
Cold blood cardioplegia was administered in an antegrade fashion through the aortic root after clamping the aorta.
The interatrial groove was developed and the common pulmonary venous chamber of the left atrium was opened through a vertical incision anterior to the right pulmonary veins, exactly as for mitral valve surgery.
After insertion of a self-retaining retractor to facilitate exposure, the diaphragm was exposed and the central hole in it was identified.
A preliminary incision out from the hole improved exposure for the definitive excision.
Orifices of the pulmonary veins on both sides were located.
Position of the atrial septum was also identified by a small opening in the right atrium and by inserting a curved clamp to displace the septum into the common pulmonary venous chamber of the left atrium.
There was no atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.
The diaphragm was then easily completely excised exposing the mitral valve (figure ​2).
The left atrial appendage was closed from inside the left atrium using a running 3-0 polypropylene suture to prevent future thrombus formation.
The atriotomy incisions were closed, the heart having been filled with blood before the last few sutures were placed.
The patient was rewarmed, the aortic cross-clamp was removed and additional de-airing was carried out in the usual manner.
CPB was terminated with minimal inotropic support, involving milrinone and levophed with good hemodynamics.
The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was extubated after 12 hours and discharged from the hospital on the fifth postoperative day.
At 3 months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic (NYHA class I), in sinus rhythm.
TTE and MRI revealed a mildly dilated LV with great improvement in systolic function and an estimated LVEF of 50%.
"
"Our patient was a 50-year old man with bicuspid aortic valve insufficiency and ascending aorta dilatation.
He had undergone a free-hand aortic homograft implantation with replacement of the non-coronary sinus using a 24-mm homograft in 2006 (at the age of 41).
Follow-up evaluations were performed every 6 months and showed mild aortic valve insufficiency.
After 8 years of follow-up, the patient presented to hospital with fever and the echocardiography showed severe aortic insufficiency due to a rupture of one of the cusps of the homograft, worsening of cardiac contractility with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) depression (40–45%) and dilatation of the left ventricle (telediastolic/telesystolic diameters 60/42 mm, respectively).
The patient presented orthopnoea and hypotension, which needed infusion of dopamine and diuretics.
Computed tomography scan showed calcifications on the homograft, pleural effusions and no signs of pericardial effusion (Fig.1).
Since the Dukes criteria for endocarditis were not satisfied, the final diagnosis was an early structural deterioration of the homograft, due to a severe calcification process.
The operation was performed through median resternotomy and with standard aorta-right atrium central cannulation for the extracorporeal circulation.
The leaflets and the annulus of the homograft presented severe calcifications and no signs of endocarditis were found.
An Edwards Intuity bioprosthesis (21 mm) was then implanted (Fig.2).
The cross-clamping time was 41 min, and the cardiopulmonary bypass time was 64 min.
The patient required dopamine and adrenaline at low doses for bypass weaning.
No complications occurred during the postoperative period.
Echocardiography before the discharge showed the absence of paravalvular leaks, a peak/mean aortic gradient of 34/20 mmHg and an LVEF of 33%.
Follow-up echocardiography after 3 months from the operation showed neither leaks nor malfunctions of the Edwards Intuity prosthesis, a peak/mean gradient of 38/22 mmHg and initial recovery of the LVEF (valued 47%).
Patient was asymptomatic again.

"An 18-year-old lady presented with history of progressive swaying while walking, worse in night since 5 years.
Speech was normal and there was not any tremulousness of upper limbs.
Also, there was no history of weakness or numbness.
The family history was significant as her elder sister had similar difficulty in walking of 7-year duration and died because of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus at an age of 20 years.
No other members of the kin were affected and there was no history of consanguinity in the parents.
The cognitive function was normal and her Mini Mental Status Score was 30/30.
Visual acuity and fundus examination were normal.
The extraocular movements including saccades, pursuits were normal, and no saccadic intrusions or nystagmus were noticed.
The tone and power were normal in all four limbs; however, there was generalised exaggeration of myotatic reflexes along with bilateral extensor plantar response.
Vibration and joint position sense were intact but Romberg's was positive.
Patient swayed to either side while performing tandem walk.
Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were normal.
Haemogram, renal, liver and thyroid function tests were normal.
Serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were within normal limits.
Nerve conduction study showed absent sensory nerve action potential with normal distal latency, conduction velocity and amplitude of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in all nerves trunks.
MRI showed marked atrophy of the cervical cord as compared to cerebellum which was normal (figure 1).
The genetic testing using PCR disclosed expansion of GAA repeat in both alleles (254 and 298) of FXN gene.
A variety of causes of autosomal recessive ataxias need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of FRDA.
These were systemically excluded here.
Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) has a phenotype quite similar to FRDA, though titubation and hyperkinesia are more common in AVED.4 A strong family history of ataxia and diabetes mellitus in elder sister favoured FRDA.
Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA) types 1 and 2 were not considered owing to lack of apraxia of ocular movements, distal amyotrophy (severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy), atrophy of cerebellum and involuntary movements.5 Ataxia telengiectesia has presentation very similar to AOA types 1 and 2.
Muco-cutaneous markers, sino-pulmonary infections, hypogammaglobulinaemia and radiosensitivity along with predisposition to development of a variety of neoplasms are features of ataxia telengiectasia not seen in AOAs and FRDA.
The other important causes of autosomal recessive spastic ataxia apart from FRDA would be autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay and Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited polyneuropathy has gait ataxia in common with FRDA; however, in this case, CMT was improbable due to following features in this case: lack of motor weakness, retained reflexes, bilaterally extensor plantar and pure sensory neuropathy on nerve conduction study.
Idebenone was started at a dose of 450 mg twice a day for its antioxidant properties.
For gait ataxia, physiotherapy—Frenkel's exercise—was initiated.
Blood glucose is monitored regularly.
At 4 months, there was no significant change in the gait difficulty.
"
"A 4 and a half years old male child presented to our hospital for abdominal swelling.
The child occasionally felt stomach ache that was relieved for no reason.
The child showed no obvious tenderness and rebound.
He was born as a premature baby in the 32nd week of his mother's pregnancy.
His medical history included inguinal hernia on 2 sides, but he had only received an operation for the left inguinal hernia.
No family or genetic history was found.
Physical examination of this child showed that the abdomen was obviously bulging.
The mass could be touched below umbilicus about 3 fingers.
There were no other positive signs.
The results of laboratory tests were almost normal, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level.
The Child–Pugh score was less than 5.
Abdominal ultrasonography showed an uneven lesion in the liver and a diagnosis of HB was considered.
Enhancement computed tomography (CT) scanning showed a large mass in the left upper abdomen and left lobe of the liver with an irregular edge.
The size of the mass was 12.3 × 10.2 × 7.2 cm (Fig.1).
There was an uneven nodular shadow and the edge was obvious when the mass was enhanced.
Calcification and an expanded bile duct were not observed.
The left branch of the portal was pressed and the distant part was shown to be unclear.
Abnormal was not observed in the right branch.
According to the medical history, the diagnosis of HB was considered.
We did not recommend a biopsy to the patient because it might cause bleeding and tumor diffusion.
An operation was necessary.
The patient underwent DVSS surgery with sufficient preparation.
Exploration showed an extrahepatic 12 × 10 cm mass in the left lobe of the liver (Fig.2).
After the operation, the sample was split.
The edge of the tumor was clear but no envelope.
Tremelloid mesenchyme was seen on the section (Fig.2C).
The pathological examination showed that the sample was grey red and 14 × 13 × 7 cm in size.
The color of the section was grey red and grey white.
MHL was diagnosed (Fig.3).
Immunohistochemistry results (Fig.4) were the following: mesenchymal CD34 (+), D2–40 (+), S-100 (-), SMA (+), CD7 (-), epithelium CK19 (+), AFP (-), HCG (-).
After 9 days of recovery, the patient returned home without complications.
A follow-up examination, which included blood routine, liver renal function, coagulation routine, and ultrasound scan at 30 days, did not show any abnormality.
No adverse or unanticipated event was presented.

"A 61-year-old male patient had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease under regular bronchodilator treatment.
In 2014, he suffered from severe productive cough with mucus sputum for several months and unintentional body weight loss 6 kg within 6 months.
After sputum analysis and chest imaging examinations in May 2014, he was diagnosed of squamous cell carcinoma in right upper lobe lung (cT3N2M0, stage IIIa).
Then he received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (etoposide 70 mg [45 mg/m2] + cisplatin 79 mg [50 mg/m2]; 4500 cGY in 25 fractions) from June to July 2014.
In October 2014, surgical intervention was arranged.
Because the tumor was located at right hilum and invaded main bronchus and major vessels, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with right side intrapericardial pneumonectomy was performed.
Postoperatively, pathological exams revealed squamous cell carcinoma, T3N0M0, stage IIB.
The postoperative course was smooth but he suffered from severe cough and right chest pain one month later.
Laboratory exams revealed leukocytosis (white blood cells = 21,860 μL) and elevated C-reactive protein to 23.94 mg/dL.
Chest X-ray showed cavitary lesion and computed tomography showed pleural effusion and fluid collection with mottled gas appearance in the dependent portion of right hemithorax (Fig.1A).
According to the patient's history, results of laboratory exams, and imaging findings, postpneumonectomy empyema was diagnosed and bronchopleural fistula was highly suspected.
After admission, chest tube drainage was inserted and bronchoscopic tissue glue sealing was performed.
However, persistent air leakage was presented and we decided to repair the bronchial stump with flap coverage.
Because the patient just received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy a few months ago, the flaps harvested from chest area were not appropriate because the pedicle arteries might have been injured by irradiation.
After discussing with the plastic surgeon, we decided to repair the bronchial stump by a TRAM flap.
Intraoperatively, the patient was placed in supine.
Right side exploratory thoracotomy was performed and the bronchial stump was located.
The superior epigastric vascular artery and right rectus abdominis muscle was identified and the location of the TRAM flap was marked on the skin (Fig.2A).
Then the TRAM flap was harvested from right rectus abdominis (Fig.2B) and was deepithelialized (Fig.2C).
Through a subcutaneous tunnel, the TRAM flap was moved toward the right thoracic space with no tension or kinking on the pedicle (Fig.2D).
Then the TRAM flap was fixed to posterior chest wall to cover the bronchial stump (Fig.2E) and the tissue glue was also applied to the bronchial stump under bronchoscope.
The donor site of flap was closed with mesh repair.
The postoperative course was smooth and the air leak was diminished gradually.
Then the patient was discharge under stable condition and was free from air leak after following for 12 months (Fig.1B).
The patient provided written informed consent for publication of this report and all accompanying images.

"A 63-year-old male patient without smoking or drinking history was admitted on June 11, 2014.
His major complaints were gradually aggravated dysphagia and fatigue, on suspicion of obstructive disease in upper digestive tract.
He had been an athlete before, and then retired in good physical status before admission.
His family and social history indicated nothing abnormal.
Thorough physical examination of his skin, oral mucosa, eyes, and genital areas failed to identify any superficial lesions.
Additionally, laboratory tests including hepatic function, renal function, and serum tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin 19 fragment, squamous cell carcinoma, neuron-specific enolase, and carbohydrate antigen 125 were all in normal range.
Therefore, further endoscopic and radiological examinations were carried out for accurate diagnosis.
Endoscopic examination revealed a slightly pigmented, irregular mass, which was located in lower esophagus, measuring 5.0 cm × 3.0 cm in size.
Fine needle biopsy of the lesion revealed esophageal melanoma, which was confirmed by histopathology.
Besides chest and abdomen computed tomography (CT), enhanced cranial magnetic resonance image (MRI) and bone emission computed tomography (ECT) showed enlarged mediastinal, nd also celiac lymph nodes (Fig.1A), without obvious involvement of supraclavicular lymph nodes.
Concurrently, the CT showed an isolated, irregular pulmonary tumor (Fig.1B).
Positron emission tomography was not carried out, because it was not covered by health insurance of this patient.
Therefore, this patient was clinically staged as cT3NxM1 according to the 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system for esophageal cancer.
CT-guided percutaneous pulmonary biopsy was avoided, with the aim to diminish the risk of tumor dissemination.
Single-stage resection of the esophageal and pulmonary lesions was assumed to be reasonable after multidisciplinary consultation, which was approved by Ethical Committee of Xuzhou Central Hospital.
Because the prognosis of this patient probably was extremely poor without targeted antibodies, which he could not afford for financial reasons.
After his informed consent, simultaneous Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy and right upper lobectomy were performed successfully, under general anesthesia, after double-lumen endotracheal intubation, followed by systemic dissection of lymph nodes located in mediastinum and abdomen, in accordance with the principles of oncological surgery.
The operation time was 290 minutes, without obvious bleeding during the surgery.
Postoperative pathological staining of the specimen revealed pleomorphic cells and abundant melanin granules (Fig.1C), whereas immunohistochemical tests demonstrated positive expression of human melanoma black 45 (HMB45), microtubule-associated protein tau 1 (MAPT1), melan A and S100, and negative expression of desmin, synaptophysin, and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), which was consistent with melanoma.
The resection margin and dissected lymph nodes were pathologically tumor-negative.
In addition, molecular study of the patient indicated mutation of V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) V600E.
Based on these findings, a diagnosis of advanced PMME was tentatively established as stage IV (pT3N0M1), because there was insufficient evidence to distinguish synchronous primary pulmonary melanoma from metastasis for this patient.
The postoperative recovery was mainly uneventful, and the patient was discharged 14 days after surgery.
Subsequently, 4 cycles of adjuvant conventional chemotherapy with an interval of 3 weeks were completed, with controlled moderate toxic effects including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
The detailed chemotherapy regimen is as follows: paclitaxel liposome for injection on day 1 and day 8 (135 mg per square meter of body surface area; Nanjing Luye Sike Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China.), tegafur injection on day 2 to 4 (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area; Shandong Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Jinan, China.) plus cis-platinum on day 2 to 3 (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area; Shandong Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Jinan, China).
This patient suffered from moderate leukopenia/ myelosuppression after the second cycle of TPF chemotherapy, and he recovered quickly after the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).
Concurrently, recombinant human interferon alpha-2b (Harbin pharmaceutical group biological engineering Co., Ltd, Harbin, China) was administrated via hypodermic injection thereafter (6000 units every 3 days; Fig.2), lasting for 1 year.
The patient was followed up continuously after the surgery.
Chest and abdomen CT, cranial MRI, bone ECT, and thorough physical examination were carried out every 3 months.
Encouragingly, the patient survived without loco-regional recurrence or remote metastasis during the follow-up of two and a half years up to now (Fig.3).
"
"A 34-year-old woman, 1 week postpartum, presented to our dermatology clinic with an intensely pruritic generalized rash.
Two days after delivery of her child, the patient developed an itchy rash on the abdomen.
On discharge, she was instructed to follow up with the dermatology department if the rash did not resolve.
After leaving the hospital, she reported that the eruption had progressively spread to the buttocks and legs and the itching seemed to be worse.
The patient's prenatal course was uneventful.
She gained 13 kg during pregnancy, with a prepregnancy weight of 72 kg.
A healthy male neonate was delivered by caesarean section at 38 weeks' gestation without complication.
The patient's medical history was unremarkable.
She was currently not taking any medications, and she reported no known drug allergies.
On physical examination, the patient was afebrile and her blood pressure was normal.
Examination of the skin revealed erythematous papules and urticarial plaques involving the abdominal striae with periumbilical sparing.
Similar lesions were noted on the legs and buttocks (Fig.1a).
The face, palms, and soles were uninvolved.
No vesicles or pustules were noted.
Based on the characteristic clinical presentation and disease course, she was diagnosed with PUPPP.
She was informed of the safety profile and potential benefits of medications but remained reluctant to use medications during lactation, despite her severe symptoms.
AWB injection was then considered for her treatment.
Venous blood of 10 mL was drawn from the patient, followed by intramuscular injection of 5 mL of the blood on each side of her buttock.
Seven days later, both subjective and objective improvements of symptoms were noticed and she received 1 more session of AWB injection (Fig.1b).
On follow-up after 12 days, all subjective symptoms had improved, leaving only postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (Fig.1c).
No complications such as infection, abscess formation, or hematoma were observed at the injection site.
"
"n March 2015, a 62-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital.
She complained of progressive visual disturbance, which began about 4 years ago and was treated as cataract in local hospital, but no relief was seen.
On the contrary, the symptoms aggravated half a year ago, together with headache, left eye pain, tearing and increased secretions, and the computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain in local hospital showed a sellar region lesion.
Besides, 2 years earlier, the patient underwent resection of melanoma in the left heel (T2N0M0, ki67 3–5%, Stage II), followed by resection of the recurred melanoma nearby the primary site 15 months later (T3N3M0, Stage III), without lymphadenectomy.
She had no family history of melanoma.
On physical examination, the patient had bilateral temporal hemianopsia, the right finger counting was 1 m, and the left finger counting was no more than 0.5 m.
Enlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the right groin.
On ophthalmologic examination, the patient had right vision of 0.4 and left vision of 0.08, with the same intraocular pressure 15 mm Hg bilaterally.
The optometry found the right eye of +6.00DS/+0.25DC∗65° and the left eye of +6.25DS/+0.50DC∗20°.
The patient had maculopathy of both eyes and optic atrophy of the left eye.
Light reflex and eye movement of both eyes were normal.
CT scans of the brain parenchyma, orbital, and chest were unremarkable.
CT scan and ultrasound examination of the abdomen showed hepatic portal and retroperitoneal lymphadenectasis and enlarged left lobe of the liver with substantial placeholder lesions.
Ultrasound examination of bilateral inguinal lymph nodes discovered multiple low echo light groups, the largest of which was 31 mm in diameter, with hilus of the echo and asymmetrical thickening of the skin.
CT scan of sellar region revealed a crumby mass, protruding out of the sphenoid sinus, with obscure boundary and bone destruction.
And the average CT value of the mass was 46 HU.
Sellar region magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a round mass of 30 mm in diameter in the enlarged sellae (Fig.1A, B).
The mass showed isointense in T1-weighted images (T1-WI) and T2-weighted images (T2-WI), with homogeneous enhancement after Gadolinium-DTPA injection, and dural tail sign was seen.
Small foci inside the tumor showed hyperintense signals in T1-WI and hypointense signals in T2-WI, without enhancement.
And it was seen that the mass penetrated meninges, surrounded the left internal carotid artery, and was blurred with the left optic nerve.
Pituitary stalk became shorter with a right displacement.
Laboratory findings revealed increased levels of prolactin (119.08 μg/L, normal range 5.99–30.04 μg/L) and cortisol (677.10 nmol/L, normal range 118.60–618.00 nmol/L) and decreased levels of free thyroxine (FT4) (6.04 pmol/L, normal range 12.00–22.00 pmol/L) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) (2.09 pmol/L, normal range 3.50–6.50 pmol/L).
The patient was diagnosed with a giant prolactinoma.
The patient underwent transnasal transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor and relieve the compression of the optic nerve.
Intraoperatively, it was seen that the tumor invaded and filled the left interval of the sphenoid sinus, and part of bone in sellar floor and left side parasellar was destroyed and absorbed.
A little normal pituitary tissue was seen in the top right of tumor in the sellar turcica.
The tumor was reddish black with extremely rich blood supply and had close adhesion to the surrounding structure.
The texture in the center of the tumor was soft and much tougher over the rim.
Intraoperative frozen-section examination found melanin granules, and it was considered to be malignant melanoma or meningioma.
The tumor cells were composed of eosinophilic staining epithelial cells.
Most of cell nuclei were round, a few were reniform and hippocrepiform with evident nucleoli, and nuclear fission was seen.
The tumor showed no evidence of necrosis (Fig.2).
The tumor was immunopositive focally for melanoma-specific markers such as S-100, HMB45, and Vimentin, and immunopositive for neuroendocrine tumor markers such as CgA and Syn (Fig.3).
The Ki67 index was 3% to 5%; it was higher in metastatic melanoma than in the adenomatous component.
Taken the melanoma history and suspected lymph node and hepatic metastasis into consideration, the patient was diagnosised with MMPA.
After surgery, significant relief was seen in visual field and headache, and the level of prolactin, cortisol, and FT4 returned to normal with hormone replacement therapy.
Because the focal liver lesions and lymphadenectasis did not cause much discomfort, the patient refused any further surgical intervention or other treatment.
She was discharged from the hospital immediately and was disease free until 2 months after the third surgery.
The patient successively found new melanoma metastatic sites in the skin of lower left leg, knees, the upper left leg, the left groin and the right groin, and the right leg.
At the follow-up in late January 2016, the patient could not walk and live by herself and was depressed.
At the latest follow-up, in late January, 2017, the patient was alive with worse symptoms, she had sensory deficits of both legs, which could not move, hyperalgesia of hands and mouth, impaired intelligence, but she lived well with the disease by careful nursing of her daughter.

"A 61-year-old Chinese woman complained of dizziness for 3 weeks and was admitted to our hospital after a bifrontal mass was found radiologically.
Other than dizziness, the patient presented no signs or symptoms that are commonly associated with neurological disease, such as headache, vomiting, sensory disturbances, altered consciousness, or seizures.
Except for a 20-year history of hypertension, which was properly controlled with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, the patient was otherwise healthy.
No special circumstances were identified regarding her personal or family history, and the patient was found to be normal upon neurological examination.
Plain and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed a space-occupying lesion in the bifrontal lobe, mainly on the right side, clinging to the sagittal sinus and the cerebral falx.
The 5.7 × 5.0 × 5.0 cm dural-based mass growing across the sagittal midline revealed isointensity on the T1-weighted image and a slight hyperintensity on the T2-weighted image and was homogenously enhanced with a characteristic “dural-tail” sign (Fig.1).
Diagnosis of a parasagittal-parafalcine meningioma was made, and a craniotomic meningioma resection was chosen as treatment.
The blood cell examination; coagulation function, liver and renal function tests; urinalysis; chest x-rays and electrocardiogram were normal.
The albumin was 36 g/L, the total bilirubin (TBil) was 12.2 μmol/L, and the direct bilirubin (DBil) was 4.1 μmol/L.
Alanine transaminase (ALT) was 17 U/L, and the international normalized ratio (INR) for coagulation values was 1.02.
Because of the patient's advanced age and history of hypertension, we performed an echocardiograph and a blood gas analysis and tested her creatine kinase levels and pulmonary functions.
The results revealed no surgical contraindications.
Written consent was obtained from the patient.
Five hundred milligrams of VPA twice per day was initiated 3 days before the operation.
The patient tolerated the administration well.
A craniotomy was then performed with a radical tumor resection (Simpson II).
The tumor was pink and solid and had a moderate blood supply, and its texture was medium.
Thirty minutes before the end of surgery, 800 mg of VPA was administered by intravenous infusion.
After the operation, the patient regained consciousness within 30 minutes and scored 15 on the Glasgow coma scale (GCS).
Two hours later as she was being transported back to her ward, the patient underwent UGH.
The vomitus (approximately 50 mL) was composed of coffee-colored blood.
Excluding the possible etiology of endotracheal intubation damage, we diagnosed the patient as experiencing acute erosive-hemorrhagic gastritis, a reaction to the craniotomy injury.
The patient was given omeprazole to inhibit gastric acid secretion, and the hematemesis ceased.
The patient was administered VPA (1200 mg, intravenously) during the first 2 postoperative days.
Because of her stomach and intestine functional recovery, the VPA dosage was changed to 500 mg via oral administration twice a day.
A brain MRI was performed on postoperative day 3, and it revealed that the tumor was radically removed and the operative field was clean (Fig.2A and B).
A subsequent paraffin histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of meningioma.
At 3 am on postoperative day 4, the patient was suddenly found in a deep coma.
Her pupils were dilated to 3.0 mm and round, and the light reflex was sensitive.
The neurological examination was unremarkable, and her vital signs were stable; however, her mental state gradually changed to a deep coma (GCS = 8), which we believed was caused by intracranial lesions.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain was immediately performed; however, it failed to reveal any abnormalities, such as severe brain swelling, intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebral infarction (Fig.2C).
Because a possible cerebral infarction could not be excluded within 24 hours, glucocorticoid, mannitol, and a vasodilator were used.
The patient's routine laboratory results for blood cell, liver, and renal functions were in relatively normal ranges.
The albumin was 33 g/L, the TBil was 13.3 μmol/L, and the DBil was 4.5 μmol/L.
ALT was 12 U/L, and the INR for coagulation values was 1.01.
Because of her history of UGH, we checked her blood ammonia levels and performed a fecal occult blood test and blood gas analysis.
Her blood ammonia was elevated (181.6 μmol/L; normal range is 11–32 μmol/L), whereas the fecal occult blood test was positive.
Thus, considering her history and elevated blood ammonia, she was diagnosed with UGH-induced hepatic encephalopathy, and the oral administration of VPA was changed to intravenous administration to prevent seizures.
Lactulose, vitamin B, and L-arginine were administered, clysis with vinegar was performed, and the patient was fasted.
The patient's blood ammonia level fluctuated (144.8–207.7 μmol/L), and she remained unconscious during the following 3 days.
Because of the unremarkable progress in the patient's mental state and blood ammonia level, we held a multidisciplinary conference to discuss diagnosis and treatment, initially considering hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
After the multidisciplinary discussion, a suspected diagnosis of VHE was finally made, even though the blood VPA level was within the normal range.
We decided to stop VPA administration before performing any dialysis and administered levetiracetam instead of VPA.
The patient's blood VPA and ammonia levels were then routinely monitored.
The patient's mental state began to improve from the first 24 hours of VPA discontinuation, and she achieved complete consciousness within 48 hours (GCS = 15).
The ammonia levels in her blood decreased dramatically and returned to normal within 4 days (Fig.3).
On postoperative day 15 (8 days after the discontinuation of VPA), the patient was discharged with no complications.
The follow-up interviews in postoperative month 5 witnessed her full consciousness and non-recurrence of the primary tumor (Fig.2D).
The patient's GCS score was 15, and she reported enjoying a satisfying quality of postoperative life.

"In 2013, a 50-year-old man patient visited hospital complaining of local bone pain in the left leg.
On August 14, 2013, the patient underwent a left distal femoral tumor en bloc resection and reconstruction with a modular femoral prosthetic system.
Pathology diagnosis confirmed osteoblastic osteosarcoma (Fig.2).
One cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with MAP regimen (high-dose methotrexate, cisplatin, and doxorubicin) were administered.
In January 2015, a mass was found on the left upper crus area.
Tumor recurrence was confirmed by biopsy on January 23, 2015.
However, only an upper femur amputation was carried out, as the patient refused hip joint replacement.
After wound healing, the patient went back to his normal life in the help of artificial limb, but refused to receive further chemotherapy due to concerns regarding the chemotherapy toxicities such as nausea, vomiting, leucopenia, deadlimb, and headache.
About half a year after the amputation, the patient got occasional cough and chest tightness.
Then a thin chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on July 15, 2015.
The CT results revealed multiple pulmonary nodules (Table ​1), considering the possibility of metastases.
The patient still rejected further chemotherapy.
Immunophenotype was suggestive of CD31+ and CD34+ tumor cells (Fig.3).
Furthermore, most cells showed strong positive staining for VEGFR-2 (Fig.3).
Apatinib was administered at a dose of 500 mg daily.
Half a month later, the symptoms disappeared, but a progressive wound necrosis appeared.
A debridement surgery was finally conducted and an enlarged lymph node near iliac vessels was resected on February 24, 2016 (Fig.(Fig.4).4).
The result of pathological examination revealed an inflammatory hyperplasia lymph node.
Apatinib administration was stopped during the 3 weeks of wound healing period.
The thin chest CT was performed 7 and 11 months following apatinib administration.
At the 7-month follow-up time point, 2 out of 5 measurable and 9 out of 17 non-measurable lesions disappeared, but 1 new measurable nodule and 6 new non-measurable lesions were observed (Table ​1, Fig.5), which considered PD according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 standard.
However, at the 11-month follow-up time point, a total of 9 lesions disappeared, including 1 measurable nodule and 2 non-measurable lesions presented before apatinib treatment as well as 6 non-measureable lesions presented 7 months after apatinib treatment.
No new lesion was raised.
After target lesion measurement according to the RECIST 1.1 standard, it was narrowly considered PR.
The toxicities the patient experienced included mild hand-foot syndrome and slight high blood pressure.
Both were well controlled after appropriate treatment.
No severe toxicities and other treatment-related adverse events were observed.
The patient continued to use apatinib as maintenance therapy without major toxic effects, and went back to normal life, even driving an automatic car.
"
"A 69-year-old man became aware of the onset of exertional dyspnea in July 2010.
He had a history of smoking for more than 40 years, 20 cigarettes per day.
His parents and 1 brother had lung cancer.
His past medical history was unremarkable.
He had no occupational exposure.
Due to the exertional dyspnea, he was admitted to the People's Hospital of Shunde District for echocardiography and computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA).
Echocardiography indicated that he had severe PAH, because his pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) was 104 mmHg, and his right heart was enlarged (the right ventricle diameter: 57 mm).
CTPA showed that he had not only PAH, but also a thrombus in the upper lobe artery of the right lung.
However, the region in the lung affected by this PE was considered too small to induce such a severe PAH.
In addition, he did not have connective tissue disease, drug use, history of chemotherapy, or HIV test (+), so he was diagnosed as IPAH combined with PE.
He was treated with warfarin (2.5 mg per day with a target of the international normalized ratio [INR] between 1.5 and 2.5) and slidenafil targeted PAH therapy (20 mg twice per day).
The patient's dyspnea was relieved slightly after the use of these medications for 1 month and the retested PAP by echocardiography was decreased to 72 mmHg, but all the other symptoms and signs failed to further improve after taking these medications for 6 months.
In March 2011, he went to the Kyorin University affiliated hospital in Japan for further treatment.
Right heart catheterization revealed PAP 72/34/47 mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 17/5/10 mmHg, cardiac output 4.3 L/min, cardiac ejection index 2.36 L/min/m2, and pulmonary vascular resistance 7.3 Wood units.
He was retested for CTPA that showed that the thrombus in the upper lobe artery of the right lung disappeared.
He was still diagnosed as having IPAH, so treated with sildenafil (20 mg 3 times a day) and sorafenib (400 mg once a day) targeted PAH therapy and oral warfarin anticoagulation therapy (2.5–3.75 mg per day, but the daily dose was adjusted by INR that was between 2 and 3).
Disappointingly, his dyspnea was not relieved and the PAP tested by the echocardiography was around 95 mmHg.
In September 2011, he visited the Shanghai Pulmonary hospital in China because of no relief of dyspnea.
Arterial blood gas analysis showed that PaO2 was 63 mmHg with oxygen saturation 93%; lung function test revealed a mild obstructive dysfunction of the pulmonary ventilation (FEV1/FVC 62.06%, FEV1% Prediction 80.9%) and a severe reduction in the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO 42%); 6-minute walk test was 385 m.
Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) (Fig.1A and B) showed smooth thickening of interlobular septa, diffuse centrilobular nodules, and the enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes.
The right heart catheterization revealed that PAP was 83/34/53 mmHg and PCWP was 14/6/11 mmHg.
Acute vasodilator testing was negative.
Coronary angiography and CTPA were both normal; pulmonary ventilation/perfusion (V’/Q’) lung scan showed a matched ventilation and perfusion defects.
Bronchoalveolar lavage showed an elevated percentage (65%) of hemosiderin-laden macrophages with the Golde score 80 (the normal range: 0–20).
He was still diagnosed as having IPAH, but he was suspected as actually having PVOD.
He was continuously treated with the targeted PAH therapy, and he was asked to continue his anticoagulation treatment, but he stopped warfarin anticoagulation treatment by himself sometime in 2014 (he failed to recall the exact date.) because he felt that it was too cumbersome to frequently test the INR for blood coagulation monitoring.
Furthermore, after he discontinued his warfarin therapy, he also failed to monitor D-Dimer to prevent PE recurrence.
His dyspnea was relatively stable, but he developed many, but not fatal, episodes of pulmonary edema during the therapy.
In January 2015, he was rushed to hospital because his dyspnea was suddenly exacerbated.
CTPA showed a thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery (Fig.1C).
Rivaroxaban was administered for anticoagulation treatment, but this medication did not relieve his dyspnea, therefore, he was too ill to walk.
Instead, he was bound to his wheelchair for half a year.
The severe PAH (suspected as PVOD) combined with a life-threatening PE mandates a lung transplantation for his survival.
Six months later, he was undergone a bilateral sequential allogenic lung transplantation assisted by veno-arterial extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) after he signed the written consent on July 29, 2015.
Histology of the explanted lung specimen showed pulmonary vein occlusion (Fig.1D–F) and the pulmonary embolism in the right pulmonary artery.
Until then, he was confirmed as having PVOD combined with PE, instead of IPAH.
He has been living well without dyspnea for more than 1 year after the lung transplantation and the echocardiography showed the normalizations of PAP and the once enlarged right ventricle of his heart.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The People's Hospital of Zhongshan City.
The written informed consent was obtained from the patient.
"
"A 65-year-old man with a 45-year history of cigarette smoking visited our hospital for the diagnosis of an abnormal chest shadow on X-ray.
He did not have any remarkable medical history and had not been prescribed anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.
A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a huge mass in the left upper lobe (maximum size: 11.0 cm in diameter) that subsequently expanded to the left hilum and mediastinum, as well as an intrapulmonary metastasis located in the left lower lobe, pleural effusion on the left side, and multiple liver tumors ranging from 0.5 to 4.7 cm in diameter (Fig.1).
Of note, some of the liver metastases were located subcapsularly, and the liver surface was irregularly distorted.
The laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cell count 11,900/mm3, hemoglobin 14.8 g/dL, platelet count 214,000/mm3, aspartate transaminase 31 IU/L, alanine transaminase 19 IU/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 749 IU/L.
No coagulation abnormalities were found.
A subsequent histological examination of a tumor specimen obtained by bronchoscopy confirmed the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma.
On considering the clinical diagnosis, performance status, and age of the patient, we decided on a regimen of antitumor chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin (60 mg/m2 body surface area on Day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 body surface area on Days 1-3).
On a day after 2 weeks from the initial CT scan, he started his first chemotherapy session.
On Day 3 after initiating chemotherapy, he complained of abdominal discomfort, and his vital signs showed tachycardia (120 beats per minute) and hypotension (85/55 mmHg).
A hematological examination showed severe anemia (hemoglobin 6.7 g/dL) that had dramatically dropped from 14.8 g/dL over 10 days.
We attempted to identify the bleeding site on gastrointestinal endoscopy, to no avail, but a CT scan revealed the rapid enlargement of a liver tumor in the left lobe, which contained partial high-density areas on the plain scan, and also a novel finding of ascites showing higher density than usual, all suggesting a ruptured liver metastasis and associated hemorrhagic ascites (Fig.2).
A subsequent contrast-enhanced CT image was negative for extravasation.
He underwent angiography for the left and right hepatic arteries, but we only observed obscure tumor vessels in the left hepatic lobe without extravasation (Fig.3A).
We suspected this might be due to the hypovascularity of the metastatic tumors and inactive bleeding at the time.
Although the benefit of therapeutic embolization of the hepatic artery was uncertain based on the findings on angiography, we performed transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the left main hepatic artery using gelform particles to prevent future re-bleeding.
Post-embolization angiography revealed a slowed blood flow in the left hepatic artery, and the peripheral vessels were weakly visualized (Fig.3B).
After the embolization concomitant with supportive therapies, including RBC transfusions of 6 U in total, the clinical course of the patient stabilized.
His blood pressure remained around 120/70 mmHg, tachycardia disappeared, and the anemia was improved after transfusion and did not progress again.
Liver dysfunction did not appear.
A month after the embolization, he was in relatively good health and re-started his antitumor chemotherapy, which he continued (first-line regimen) for six courses.
A good partial response was gained after chemotherapy for both the lung and liver lesions.

"A 41-year-old man with a history of alcoholism for 10 years and sober for the last 3 years, recurrent alcoholic pancreatitis, and no known liver disease, presented with several episodes of hematemesis and abdominal pain for 2 days.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), performed 3 years earlier for abdominal pain, had revealed no esophageal varices, gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, or other GI lesions.
Physical examination revealed a blood pressure = 100/60 mm Hg, pulse = 60 beats/min, no jaundice, no stigmata of chronic liver disease, a soft abdomen with mild epigastric tenderness but no rebound tenderness, no abdominal bruit, and no pulsatile abdominal mass.
Rectal examination revealed gross melena.
Laboratory tests revealed hemoglobin = 12.5 g/dL, platelets = 301,000/mL, INR (international normalized ratio) = 1.0, blood urea nitrogen = 20 mg/dL, and creatinine = 1.1 mg/dL.
Serum aspartate aminotransferase = 21 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase = 16 IU/L, total bilirubin = 0.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase = 64 IU/L, albumin = 4.4 gm/dL, and lipase = 32 U/dL.
The hemoglobin declined acutely to 9.3 g/dL.
Abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography (CT), with intravenous contrast, revealed a 5-cm wide, irregular, pancreatic/peripancreatic mass, compressing both the lesser curvature of the stomach and the SV (Fig.1A, B), a normal portal vein, and normal liver parenchyma.
The SV compression was pathophysiologically significant as indicated by proximal SV dilatation.
EGD revealed in the proximal stomach a fine, reticular, pale-white, polygonal, mucosal, network in a snakeskin pattern, and characteristic of portal hypertensive gastropathy that was actively oozing; extensive coffee-ground, blood clots in the stomach; small gastric cardial and fundal varices without stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH); and no esophageal varices (Fig.​2).
The extrinsic mass produced a large, round bulge extending into the lumen of the proximal gastric body along the lesser curvature (Fig.2).
Magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP) revealed a 5-cm wide, enhancing, vascular mass likely arising from the LGA and located between the gastric lesser curvature and distal pancreatic body; compressing the stomach; compressing the middle SV; and resulting in large collateral veins draining the SV into the superior mesenteric vein (Fig.3A, B).
Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler studies demonstrated large, turbulent arterial flow into this vascular mass, suggesting a large PA (Fig.4).
Visceral arteriogram showed a 5.3 × 2.2-cm-wide PA supplied by an LGA branch (Fig.5A), which was embolized and occluded with microcoils (Fig.5B).
Eight weeks later, the patient had a stable hemoglobin level with no further GI bleeding.
Abdomino-pelvic CT angiography demonstrated the PA had markedly decreased in diameter, contained numerous microcoils, and had no blood flow ​(Fig.1C).
"
"An 82-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital because of dyspnea and massive hemoptysis.
The patient had a history of bronchial asthma that was well-controlled with bronchodilator medications.
She had no history of tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or smoking.
The physical examination revealed diffuse bilateral crackles.
She suffered from severe hypoxemia (pH 7.362, PCO2 35.1 mmHg, PO2 61.0 mmHg, HCO3- 20.1 mmHg, BE -5.5 mmHg, SpO2 90.5%, under 10 L O2/min, reservoir mask).
After the tracheal intubation, 100 mL of bright-red blood was aspirated.
A chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates (Fig.1).
A chest CT further demonstrated multiple consolidations and ground glass opacity and focal bronchiectasis in right segment 4 (S4) (Fig.2).
There were no space-occupying lesions.
Four days after admission, her respiratory condition was improved.
Since there was no active hemorrhaging from the tracheal tube, she was then extubated.
After that, only a small amount of bloody sputum was coughed up.
To determine the origin of bleeding, she underwent contrast-enhanced CT, which showed bronchiectasis in right S4 and regression of the infiltration.
CTA revealed an abnormal vascular anastomosis between the right inferior phrenic artery and right pulmonary artery beside the focal bronchiectasis at the right middle lobe (Fig.3), which led us to suspect it as the possible source of the massive hemoptysis.
We therefore performed embolization by superselecting the right inferior phrenic artery with a 2.2-Fr. microcatheter (Fig.4).
An angiogram of the right bronchial artery showed no obvious active bleeding.
Three weeks after the embolization, she was successfully discharged and has been free from recurrent hemoptysis for three years.

"A 41-year-old Caucasian woman underwent a primary double lung transplantation for cystic fibrosis in 2006.
Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable and the patient had no known history of pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculosis contact.
On December 2015, she underwent retransplantation for chronic lung allograft dysfunction.
During the month preceding retransplantation, 4 sputum specimens remained negative for acid-fast bacilli and specific M. tuberculosis culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.
On postoperative day 42, deterioration of her respiratory status prompted a chest-computerized tomography (CT) scan revealing sub-centimeter bilateral nodules primarily located in the apical posterior lobes and a bilateral pleural effusion (Fig.1).
The same day, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) yielded a positive real-time PCR for rifampicin-susceptible M. tuberculosis, confirmed by culture on postoperative day 62.
Tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) test were not performed.
All the BALs performed on postoperative period yielded no other pathogen except for the one performed on day 60 that cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the adjunctive antibiotic therapy was imipenem-cilastatin, 3 g/d.
Histological examination of a lung biopsy performed 6 weeks after retransplantation revealed a caseating granuloma and necrosis.
Acid-fast bacilli were identified as rifampicin-susceptible M. tuberculosis by real-time PCR.
On postoperative day 65, the patient's status worsened with severe hypoxemia, shock unresponsive to high dose cathecolamines, and multiorgan failure.
The patient died on postoperative day 70, despite treatment combining isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.
Retrospective real-time PCR testing of the explanted lung and BALs performed on postoperative days 1, 7, and 21 remained negative.
The organ donor died of posttraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage.
He was a 47-year-old man with no history of lung disease or risk factors for tuberculosis other than chronic alcohol use and smoking.
TST results were not available.
During hospitalization, a lung CT-scan showed no signs of active or previous tuberculosis and no TST or IGRA test results were available.
Routine cultures of per-transplantation right lung biopsy yielded Candida albicans.
Retrospective M. tuberculosis real-time PCR yielded negative results on the left and right donor-lung biopsies.
Both kidneys from the same donor were transplanted into 2 other recipients.
Six months after transplantation, neither of the kidney recipients had developed any signs or symptoms suggestive of active tuberculosis.

"A 33-year-old Moroccan man with a 5-month history of recurring sinusitis presented with temperature, myalgia, cough, and hemoptysis.
Thoracic physical examination revealed reduced vesicular murmur, and chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates.
Laboratory analyses showed elevation of acute-phase proteins (CRP 26 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.2 mg/dL) with nonnephrotic proteinuria and microscopic glomerular hematuria.
An antibiotic therapy for community acquired and atypical pneumoniae with levofloxacin 500 mg daily iv was established, but on the 3rd day from admission the patient developed respiratory failure unresponsive to noninvasive ventilation and had to be intubated.
White lung with consolidations and ground glass areas at computed tomography scan (Fig.1), diffuse airways bleeding at fiberoptic bronchoscopy, mild normocytic anemia (9 g/dL), and ANCA-PR3 positivity (18.9 U/mL) were consistent with the diagnosis of GPA.
Despite maximal ventilatory support, gas exchange did not improve (pH 7.33, PaO2 71 mm Hg, PaCO2 51 mm Hg, HCO3– 25 mmol/L, SaO2 94%) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 days and 1 mg/kg daily thereafter), cyclophosphamide (1.2 g/pulse every 2 weeks for the 1st 3 pulses, followed by infusions every 3 weeks for the next 2 pulses), and plasma exchange (PE), according to European vasculitis study group recommendations,[4] was immediately started with respiratory improvement that allowed ECMO and orotracheal tube withdrawal and subsequent discharge from intensive care unit.
After 9 days from the beginning of treatment ANCA-PR3 levels normalized (3 U/mL).
Two months later, after the 5th bolus of cyclophosphamide and with prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/day, the patient complained arthromyalgia and testicular pain with edema, cough, and shortness of breath: laboratory data showed worsening of renal function, mild anemia, and hypoxemia (PaO2 61 mm Hg).
Epididymitis was confirmed by ultrasound.
Because of rapidly progressive renal failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate 35 mL/min) renal biopsy was performed and showed prominent intracapillary and extracapillary proliferation, with the formation of some fibrocellular crescents and focal capillary necrosis (Fig.2).
Lung computed tomography-scan and fiberoptic bronchoscopy also confirmed alveolar hemorrhage relapse.
Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g daily for 3 consecutive days) and rituximab (375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks) was started with rapid resolution of urologic and pulmonary involvement but delayed and partial improvement of renal function.
At a 1-year follow-up, the patient is alive and under treatment with azathioprine (150 mg daily) and prednisone (15 mg daily).
Renal function has markedly improved (estimated glomerular filtration rate 94 mL/min) same as gas-exchange (pH 7.42, PaO2 86 mm Hg, PaCO2 36 mm Hg, HCO3– 23 mmol/L, SaO2 95%).
The patient signed institutional informed consent form at the time of admission to hospitalization.
An approval by ethics committee was not necessary because of the routine health care.

"A 16-year-old female suffered from an abdominal pain at right upper quadrant, lasting for more than 10 days.
Shortly ahead of her medical consultation, 4 ascaris-like worms were vomited out, individually with a length of about 10 cm.
She had a previous onset of ascariasis, during which low-grade fever (38.4°C) occurred without apparent jaundice, diarrhea, or anemia.
Physical examination revealed tenderness at right upper quadrant.
Her total leukocyte count was 11.2 G/L consisting of 5.2% eosinophils.
Serum and urine amylase were 386 and 928 U/L, respectively.
In terms of liver functionality, the level of total bilirubin rose up to 23.2 μm/L, meanwhile the hepatic enzymes were similarly elevated (alanine aminotransferase 163 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase 96 U/L).
Abdominal ultrasound described the enlargement of the gallbladder, upper segment of common bile duct (1.5 cm in diameter) and intrahepatic bile duct (1.3 cm in diameter).
Furthermore, the intrahepatic bile duct was also discovered to be filled with echogenic and banded substances.
Based on such evidences, she was clinically diagnosed as biliary ascariasis with a concomitant manifestation of biliary duct infection.
Through a laparoscopic exploration, the enlarged gallbladder and common bile duct were visually confirmed, as well as the massive storage of worms within the biliary tract.
Subsequently, a 1 cm incision was made on the common bile duct in order to facilitate the extraction of the pathogenic worms, which were then placed into a specimen bag laparoscopically (Fig.1).
Once the contained worms were virtually cleared out under laparoscope, chodedochoscopy was employed to seek for more hidden worms inside the biliary system (Fig.2).
After finishing the removal of ascarides, the biliary duct incision was well sutured, with a T-tube placed in situ (Fig.3).
Eventually, a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed, followed by the removal of specimen bags and drainage tube placement (Fig.4).
The total amount of worms inside the common bile duct summed up to more than 100 (Fig.5).
Postoperatively, she was treated with oral antihelminthic drugs for 3 days.
The T-tube was rinsed with saline every day, and during the first 3 days, 6 more worms were additionally washed out.
The patient experienced a smooth postoperative recovery and was finally discharged from hospital without any complications.

"A 60-year-old man presented with a retroperitoneal metastatic lymph node in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with a history of right liver resection in 2010, pulmonary wedge resection in 2012, and transarterial chemoembolization twice in 2014, in which the postoperative pathology suggested the mixed liver cancer, and poorly differentiated lung cancer from liver metastasis.
At examination, the tumor was very close to the duodenum, pancreas, stomach, and hepatic portal vein.
The patient with unresectable masses had hypertension over 10 years and chronic HBV-related cirrhosis for 30 years when he was treated with lamivudine 100 mg qd, and adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg qd for 6 years.
He kept a constant body temperature of 37 °C, the blood pressure of 148/96 mm Hg, and the pulse of 77 beats every minute.
The patient had no obvious sense of abdominal pain, abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting.
On a test of tumor markers levels, the results were normal, which showed carcinoembryonic antigen 3.7 ng/mL, alpha fetoprotein 17.3 ng/mL, and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 levels 6.1 U/mL.
In this study, the procedure was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
The efficacy of local ablation was estimated with Choi criteria, which appraised the variations both in tumor size and lesion density on computed tomography (CT) imaging: complete response, disappearance of all lesions and no new lesions; partial response (PR), a decrease in size of 10% or a decrease in tumor density over 15% on CT and no new lesions; stable disease, not fit for complete response, PR, or progressive disease; and progressive disease, an increase in tumor size over 10% and not fit for PR by tumor density on CT or new lesions.[19]
Preoperative MR imaging scan showed a mass of 2.8 × 3.5 cm in size close to the duodenum, pancreas, and blood vessels (Fig.1A).
During substance phase, MR images indicated mildly high signal intensity around the tumor and intermediate low signal intensity in the solid component and in the walls (Fig.1B).
Before the initial ablation, there was a retroperitoneal mild hyperechoic area on axial US image (Fig.1C).
In this study, the inpatient underwent percutaneous transhepatic biopsies and ablations to avoid the nearby blood vessels, the procedure of which was performed about 40 minutes under local anesthesia and mild sedation.
We used ultrasonography to real-timely guide the inserting of 2 Nd:YAG laser fibers (Echolaser X4, ESAOTE, Italy) in 0.3 mm diameter through a 21-gauge Chiba needle into the lesions (Fig.1D).
Although part of the heat ran off by blood flow,[20] ablation could keep valid area from 12 to 15 mm with the power of 5 W in 5 to 6 minutes.
Subsequently, immediate ultrasonography showed that the whole lesion was covered with hyperechoic zone (Fig.​(Fig.1E and F).
However, the next day contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) revealed an abnormal residual of proximal part of the pancreatic head (Fig.2A).
At 5-day follow-up contrast-enhanced CT images, the lower mass had low signal intensity and upper tumor revealed intermediate high signal intensity of residual in substance phase (Fig.2B and C).
Surprizingly, 1-week follow-up CEUS image showed an enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node located near the pancreatic head, which could be fusion of these residuary small nodules (Fig.2D).
Then the patient undergoing the 2nd ablation with 2 laser fibers showed the lesions well-defined hyperechoic zone (Fig.2E and F).
On the 2nd day, postoperative CEUS images showed they were still remanent (Fig.2G and I).
At the corresponding MR imaging, it also showed this in left of tumor (Fig.2H).
Thus, the 3rd laser ablation was performed (Fig.2J)2J) and 3 days later CEUS found that there was still a minor lesion located in the separation gap of last 2 needles (Fig.3A).
Subsequently the patient had the 4th ablation along this separation gap until hyperechoic overlay (Fig.3B–D), then 3 days later, based on these 4 treatments, enhanced CT image of the retroperitoneal mass suggested complete necrosis (Fig.3E–G).3E–G).
After the following 1 month, substance phase MR revealed low-intensity signal of tumor necrosis with resolution of his problems (Fig.3H).
Until 5 months after 4 ablations, CT showed the tumor PR with little enhanced recurrence (yellow arrows), which located in the left lower edge of original lesions (Fig.4A and B).
On laboratory test of tumor markers, the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha fetoprotein, and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 indicated 3.6 ng/mL, 26.7 ng/mL, and 8.1 U/mL, respectively.
No obvious side effects were discovered in this case during these procedures.

"A 58-year-old cotton farmer was presented to the West China Hospital of Sichuan University because of an over 1-month history of recurrent fever (between 38 and 40 °C), productive cough, and dyspnea.
Prior to admission, he was diagnosed of pneumonia and treated with latamoxef, ofloxacin, vancomycin, and voriconazole at local hospital.
However, no remission of symptoms was observed.
Moreover, he was a hepatitis B virus carrier with a 10 pack-years smoking history.
However, no history of diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and use of glucocorticoids in the past were informed.
On admission, blood pressure, 145/95 mm Hg; heart rate, 120 per minute; respiratory rate, 30 per minute; and temperature, 39.3 °C.
Physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds, but no rales were heard, and evaluation of other systems was unremarkable except moderate edema of lower limbs.
Arterial blood gases analysis showed pH 7.361, PCO2 53.5 mm Hg, and PO2 62.8 mm Hg.
Laboratory data (Table ​(Table1)1) revealed leukocytosis of 49,500/mm3 with 97.4% neutrophils, and elevated procalcitonin of 5.16 ng/mL.
Chest computed tomography, presence of nodules, masses, patchy consolidations, and bilateral pleural effusion, is noted (Fig.1A).
Meanwhile, it was soon alerted in sputum smear with presence of filamentous, gram-positive, weakly acid-fast, and beaded bacilli with possible diagnosis of Nocardia infection (Fig.1B, C).
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (3 pills per 6 hours) with noninvasive ventilation was promptly administered.
Sputum culture showed growth of numerous bacteria that were precisely determined to be N otitidiscaviarum by the method of mass spectroscopy on day 6 after admission (Fig.1D).
Antibiotics were thus modified to amikacin and imipenem in addition to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in accordance with the sensitivity test.
However, the patient was not improved as expected and eventually died from severe respiratory insufficiency on the 13th hospital day.

"The proband (II-2 in Fig.2) is a 45-year old woman, who first presented to our university hospital at the age of 35 and was referred to us because of her pregnancy.
She has congenital deafness, first experienced syncope at the age of 3, and was diagnosed with epilepsy.
She was treated with anti-epilepsy medications; however, she subsequently experienced several instances of syncope.
At the age of 13, she had a syncope event, and was suspected of having JLNS because of her congenital deafness and prolonged QT interval.
Her syncope was diagnosed as an arrhythmic episode when she was aware of tachycardia and as epilepsy when she was not.
She also had a subarachnoid hemorrhage at the age of 29.
When she first presented at our hospital, she was not taking beta-blockers, because of a history of asthma, but was taking mexiletine in addition to phenytoin.
Her QTc was found to be prolonged (584 ms) at presentation and administration of atenolol was initiated.
She delivered her baby (III-1 in Fig.2) through Caesarean operation at our hospital at the age of 35.
At 37, she delivered her second baby (III-2 in Fig.2) through Caesarean operation at our hospital.
Despite administration of beta-blockers, her QTc remained prolonged (600 msec at the age of 37, 780 msec at 44) (Figs.2 and ​3a), which is not unexpected because treatment with beta-blockers in LQTS1 is not expected to overtly reduce QTc [18].
However, she continued to experience occasional syncope and finally underwent an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) operation at 38 years of age.
Subsequently, she is in a stable clinical condition.
Because the proband was suspected of JLNS and both infants had a measured QTc of 500 ms or greater within 1 month after birth, beta blockers were initiated and both children remain in stable condition at ages 10 and 8 (Figs.2 and 3b, c).
QTc of the son (III-1 in Fig.2) was measured as 500 ms one month after birth, while the QTc of his sister (III-2) was 530 ms at birth.
The father (I-1) and mother (I-2) of the proband were first cousins.
There is no history of sudden unexplained syncope or death of children or adults in the immediate family members, despite the prolonged QTc of the children.
Clinical evaluation and consultation of the proband and her family members were performed at Chiba University Hospital.
Clinical phenotypes were deduced from the clinical history, physical examinations, and ECG.
Blood samples were collected from the proband and her family members following genetic counseling, and written informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection.
Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to established protocols at our laboratory [19].
Entire coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the genes, of KCNQ1 (NCBI ref: NM_000218) and other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to established protocols in our laboratory.
Briefly, 30–100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase; Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) and primer sets.
The amplicons were subjected to conventional sequencing with Sanger sequencers (Applied Biosystems 3730/3130 DNA analyzers; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The sequence data were processed with Gene Codes Sequencher Software (Takara Bio Inc.) and mapped to the human genome sequence (build GRCh37/hg19).
Genetic analysis was performed to screen all coding exons and the exon–intron boundaries of the KCNQ1 gene (NCBI ref: NM_000218.2, NP_000209.2) with concurrent screening of other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5).
We detected a novel homozygous nonsense variant, NM_000218.2:c.115G > T (p.Glu39X, in exon 1a), in the KCNQ1 gene of the proband, as well as a homozygous common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg) (Additional file 1: Table S1).
Genetic screening of her mother (I-2) and children (III-1 and III-2) revealed that they were heterozygous for the nonsense variant (Fig.2).
Her husband (II-3) was also screened and found to be heterozygous for the common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C > G, p.Pro448Arg).
The proband is a child from a first-cousin marriage, and we have concluded the homozygous nonsense variant in the proband is the cause of her JLNS1.
The proband was negative for pathogenic variants in other LQT causative genes, including the KCNE1 gene (Additional file 1: Table S1).

"A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital for the evaluation of dysphagia for 9 months.
He had associated symptoms of nausea and vomiting but denied hematemesis, hematochezia, lethargy, and dyspnea.
He was an active smoker and consumed alcohol for 30 years.
Physical examination revealed no peripheral lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, ascites, or mass in the abdomen.
Laboratory data were normal: HBs-Ag negative, HIV negative, and syphilis negative.
Test for serum antibody against Helicobacter pylori was negative.
Chest computed tomography (CT) was notable for a huge well-circumscribed and homogeneous cylindrical mesenchymal neoplasm measuring 15.5×5.9×4.0 cm in lower and middle esophagus with mild contrast enhancement (Fig.1A).
CT revealed no abnormalities in the lungs, heart, ribs, or mediastinum.
Endoscopic examination showed a submucosal lesion in the esophagus starting at 20 cm from the incisor teeth extending up to the cardia (Fig.1B).
Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed hypoechoic lesion with a clear boundary located in the 4th layer.
The mass appeared as a benign tumor and was preoperatively diagnosed as esophageal leiomyoma based on chest CT, endoscopic examination, and EUS findings.
Endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal resection was not possible because of large size.
Hence, surgical resection was planned and informed written consent was taken.
The patient underwent thoracoscopic-assisted resection of the mass with gastroesophageal anastomosis, thoracic duct ligation, and jejunostomy.
Postoperative course was uneventful.
Grossly, a spindle shaped lump measuring 14 × 3.5 × 2.5 cm, was observed in the resected esophagus, which grew into the esophageal lumen and blocked most of lumen.
This lump located in the submucosa was covered with intact mucosa, without erosion, ulcer, and hemorrhage.
Its cut surface was homogenously white to grayish-white in color.
Histological examination using hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that tumor was covered with intact squamous epithelium, arising from the submucosal layer and expanding in to the muscular layer.
The tumor was composed of many nodules of varying sizes separated by collagen fibers.
Numerous cytoplasm-rich cells were observed in the collagenous septations with invasive growth pattern (Fig.2A–C).
The nodules were mainly composed of small to mid-sized centrocyte-like or monocyte-like cells arranged in diffuse pattern.
These atypical lymphocytes possessed clear boundary, pale cytoplasm, irregular nucleus, and occasional nucleolus (Fig.2D).
Mitosis was rare.
No lymphoepithelial lesion was recognized in the lesion.
On immunohistochemical staining, epithelium was diffusely positive for cytokeratin (Fig.3A), and the tumor cells were diffusely positive for cluster of differentiation (CD)20, paired box 5 (Fig.3B), and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 (Fig.3D).
Small deposits of tumor cells, which were distributed mainly in the collagen fibers, were positive for multiple myeloma oncogene 1, CD138, and CD43.
Several tumor cells were also positive for CD30.
Small lymphocytes were positive for CD3 and CD5.
Follicular dendritic cells were positive for CD21 and CD23 (Fig.3C).
All cells were negative for CyclinD1, CD10, Bcl-6, and B lymphocyte specific activation of OCT binding protein 1.
These follicular dendritic cells were arranged in nodules in which the tumor cells were relatively evenly distributed.
This pattern was suggestive of follicular colonizations seen in MALT lymphoma.
In this case, gene rearragements and clonality analysis of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene, kappa light chain gene, and lambda light chain gene was performed using the IdentiCloneTM IGH/IGK/IGL Gene Clonality Assay (InVivoScribe Technologies, CA).
On monoclonal gene rearrangement, 1 band appeared within 150 to 175 base pairs (bp) in heavy chain gene, 2 discrete bands within 225 to 250 bp in kappa light chain gene, and 1 band within 125 to 150 bp in lambda light chain gene (Fig.4).
In addition, no Epstein–Barr virus was observed in this lymphoma on in situ hybridization using the EB virus-encoded small RNA (Fig.3E, F).
Based on the clinical data, pathological, immunohistochemical, and gene rearragements analysis, final diagnosis of primary esophageal MALT lymphoma was made.
After the surgical resection, no additional therapy in the form of chemotherapy or radiotherapy was administered.
Over the 8 months of follow-up, no evidence of recurrence or metastases was found on CT and the patient has been asymptomatic.
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Medical Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital, the Third Military Medical University.
Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and the accompanying images.

"A 47-year-old female patient presented progressively worsening pain in the chest wall, back, and bilateral lower extremities as well as muscle weakness.
She did not have a family history of bone disease or fractures.
Physical examination was unremarkable excluding bone and muscular abnormalities.
Bone scintigraphy using technetium-99m methylenediphosphate showed increased uptake in the shoulder, multiple ribs, thoracic and lumbar spines, bilateral sacroiliac joints, left ilium, and left foot (Fig.1).
Plain radiographs revealed osteoporosis change of thoracic and lumbar spine as well as compression change of several spines, consistent with findings of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT) (Fig.1).
Decreased bone mass was presented in the lumbar spine (T-score: −3.4), femoral neck (T-score: −3.1), and hip (T-score: −3.5).
Main laboratory data are shown in Table ​1.
She demonstrated hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypouricemia, elevated level of ALP, C-telopeptides and chloride, and decreased carbon dioxide combining power.
The urinalysis revealed a high pH value, increased level of potassium, and decreased level of specific gravity, chlorine, and phosphate.
Persistent glycosuria and proteinuria were repeatedly found, despite normal HbA1c and plasma glucose level.
Other laboratory test results including thyroid function test, serum parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and protein electrophoresis were within normal range.
In addition, all of serum tumor markers were negative.
Due to limited technique, we cannot determine the level of serum fibroblast growth factor 23.
With the clinical diagnosis of HO, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and technetium-99m octreotide (99mTc-OCT) scintigraphy were performed to confirm whether the occult causative tumor exist.
However, the results of these 2 tests were negative except that mild uptake in the seventh rib was found on PET/CT, which identified no evidence of a neoplastic lesion potentially responsible for HO (Fig.2).
The immunological examination showed elevated level of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA, as well as positive antinuclear antibody, anti-SSA antibody, and rheumatic factor.
Subsequently, Schirmer test was abnormal and lip biopsy supported the diagnosis of SS (Fig.3).
Eventually, this patient was diagnosed with HO secondary to SS, and she was then treated with alkalinization (citrate 4 g/day and potassium citrate 3 g/day for 2 weeks), steroids (prednisone 20 mg/day for 1 month, 10 mg/day for 4 months), neutral phosphate (1.0 g/day for 5 months), calcium supplements (600 mg/day for 5 months), and together with activated vitamin D (0.5 g/day for 5 months).
So far, she recovered uneventfully with relieved pain and increased serum phosphorus level.
This case report was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, and the written informed consent was obtained.
